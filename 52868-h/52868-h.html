        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an exceedingly
        interesting article on the early study of the Dutch in Japan, by
        Professor K. Mitsukuri,<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> the
        author has occasion to refer to the uncle of one of the three famous
        Japanese scholars who translated into Japanese a Dutch book on
        anatomy. He says this uncle <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMiyada was
        almost eccentric in his disposition. He held it to be a solemn duty
        to learn any art or accomplishment that might be going out of the
        world, and then describe it so fully that it might be preserved to
        posterity.‚Äù</span> The nephew was faithful to his uncle's
        instructions, and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthough following medicine
        for his profession, he took it upon himself to learn <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äòhitoyogiri,‚Äô</span>‚Äîa certain kind of music which was
        well-nigh forgotten,‚Äîand even went so far as to study a kind of
        dramatic acting.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though not
        animated by Miyada's spirit when I set about the task of collecting
        the material embodied in this work, I feel now that the labor has not
        been altogether in vain, as it may result in preserving many details
        of the Japanese house,‚Äîsome of them trivial, perhaps,‚Äîwhich in a few
        decades of years may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain.
        Whether this has been accomplished or not, the praiseworthy ambition
        of the old Japanese scholar might well be imitated by the
        ethnological student in his investigations,‚Äîsince nothing can be of
        greater importance than the study of those nations and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span> peoples who are passing
        through profound changes and readjustments as a result of their
        compulsory contact with the vigorous, selfish, and mercantile nations
        of the West, accompanied on their part by a propagandism in some
        respects equally mercenary and selfish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thanks to the
        activity of a number of students of various nationalities in the
        employ of the Japanese government, and more especially to the
        scholarly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">attach√©s</span></em> of the English legation in
        Japan, much information has been obtained concerning this interesting
        people which might otherwise have been lost. If investigators and
        students would bear in mind the precept of Miyada, and seize upon
        those features in social life‚Äîforms of etiquette, frames, ceremonies,
        and other manners and customs‚Äîwhich are the first to change in any
        contact with alien races, a very important work would be accomplished
        for the future sociologist. The native Japanese student might render
        the greatest service in this work by noting down from the older
        persons, before it is too late, the social features and habits of his
        own people as they were before the late Revolution. Profound changes
        have already taken place in Japan, and other changes are still in
        progress. As an indication of the rapidity of some of these changes,
        reference might be made to an interesting memoir, by Mr. McClatchie,
        on <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe Feudal Mansions of Yedo;‚Äù</span> and
        though this was written but ten years after the revolution of 1868,
        he speaks of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashiki,</span></em> or fortified mansions where
        dwelt the feudal nobles of Japan, as in <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmany
        cases deserted, ruined, and fallen into decay;‚Äù</span> and he
        describes observances and manners connected with the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yashiki,</span></em>
        such as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúetiquette of the gates,‚Äù</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúexchange of yashiki,‚Äù</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúrules relating to fires,‚Äù</span> etc., which were then
        obsolete at the time of his writing, though in full force but a few
        years before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall be
        particularly grateful for any facts concerning the Japanese house
        beyond those recorded in this book, or which <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pageix">[pg ix]</span> may be already in my possession, as also
        for the correction of any errors which may have unavoidably been made
        in the text. Should a second edition of this work be called for, such
        new information and corrections will be incorporated therein, with
        due acknowledgments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I wish to express
        my gratitude to Dr. W. S. Bigelow, whose delightful companionship I
        enjoyed during the collection of many of the facts and sketches
        contained in this volume, and whose hearty sympathy and judicious
        advice were of the greatest service to me. To Professor and Mrs. E.
        F. Fenollosa, also, my thanks are especially due for unnumbered
        kindnesses during my last visit to Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I would also here
        return my thanks to a host of Japanese friends who have at various
        times, in season and out of season, granted me the privilege of
        sketching their homes and examining their dwellings from top to
        bottom in quest of material for this volume; who furthermore have
        answered questions, translated terms, hunted up information, and in
        many ways aided me,‚Äîso that it may be truly said, that had this
        assistance been withheld, but little of my special work could have
        been accomplished. Any effort to recall the names of all these
        friends would lead to the unavoidable omission of some; nevertheless,
        I must specially mention Mr. H. Takamine, Director of the Tokio
        Normal School; Dr. Seiken Takenaka; Mr. Tsunejiro Miyaoka; Mr. S.
        Tejima, Director of the Tokio Educational Museum; Professors Toyama,
        Yatabe, Kikuchi, Mitsukuri, Sasaki, and Kozima, and Mr. Ishikawa and
        others, of the University of Tokio; Mr. Isawa and Mr. Kodzu, Mr.
        Fukuzawa, the distinguished teacher and author; Mr. Kashiwagi, Mr.
        Kohitsu, and Mr. Masuda. I must also acknowledge my indebtedness to
        Mr. H. Kato, Director of the University of Tokio, to Mr. Hattori,
        Vice-director, and to Mr. Hamao and other officers of the Educational
        Department, for many courtesies, and for special accommodations
        during my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span> last
        visit to Japan. Nor must I omit to mention Mr. Tachibana, Director of
        the nobles' school; Mr. Kikkawa, Mr. Tahara, Mr. Kineko, Mr. Ariga,
        Mr. Tanada, Mr. Nakawara, Mr. Yamaguchi, Mr. Negishi of Kabutoyama,
        and many others, who supplied me with various notes of interest. In
        this country I have been specially indebted to Mr. A. S. Mihara and
        Mr. S. Fukuzawa, for valuable assistance during the preparation of
        the text; and to Mr. Arakawa, Mr. Shiraishi, Mr. Shugio, and Mr.
        Yamada of New York, for timely aid.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the Board of
        Trustees of the Peabody Academy of Science, who, recognizing the
        ethnological value of the work I had in hand, granted me a release
        from my duties as Director until I could complete it; and to
        Professor John Robinson, Treasurer of the Academy, and Mr. T. F.
        Hunt, for friendly suggestions and helpful interest, as also to Mr.
        Percival Lowell for numerous courtesies,‚Äîmy thanks are due. I must
        not forget to record here my indebtedness to Mr. A. W. Stevens, chief
        proof-reader of the University Press, for his invaluable assistance
        in the literary part of my labors, and for his faithful scrutiny of
        the proof-sheets. At the same time I desire to thank Miss Margarette
        W. Brooks for much aid given to me in my work; my daughter, Miss
        Edith O. Morse, for the preliminary tracings of the drawings from my
        journals; Mr. L. S. Ipsen, who drew the unique and beautiful design
        for the cover of this book; Mr. A. V. S. Anthony for judicious
        supervision of the process-work in the illustrations; the University
        Press for its excellent workmanship in the printing of the book; and
        the Publishers for the generous manner in which they have supported
        the undertaking. I will only add, that the excellent Index to be
        found at the end of this book was prepared by Mr. Charles H.
        Stevens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within twenty
        years there has gradually appeared in our country a variety of
        Japanese objects conspicuous for their novelty and beauty,‚Äîlacquers,
        pottery and porcelain, forms in wood and metal, curious shaped boxes,
        quaint ivory carvings, fabrics in cloth and paper, and a number of
        other objects as perplexing in their purpose as the inscriptions
        which they often bore. Most of these presented technicalities in
        their work as enigmatical as were their designs, strange caprices in
        their ornamentation which, though violating our hitherto recognized
        proprieties of decoration, surprised and yet delighted us. The
        utility of many of the objects we were at loss to understand; yet
        somehow they gradually found lodgment in our rooms, even displacing
        certain other objects which we had been wont to regard as decorative,
        and our rooms looked all the prettier for their substitution. We
        found it difficult to formulate the principles upon which such art
        was based, and yet were compelled to recognize its merit. Violations
        of perspective, and colors in juxtaposition or coalescing that before
        we had regarded as inharmonious, were continually reminding us of
        Japan and her curious people. Slowly our methods of decoration became
        imbued with these ways so new to us, and yet so many centuries old to
        the people among whom these arts had originated. Gradually yet
        surely, these arts, at first so little understood, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span> modified our own methods
        of ornamentation, until frescos wall-papers, wood-work and carpets,
        dishes and table-cloth metal work and book-covers, Christmas cards
        and even railroad advertisements were decorated, modelled, and
        designed after Japanese style.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not to be
        wondered at that many of our best artists,‚Äîmen like Coleman, Vedder,
        Lafarge, and others,‚Äîhad long fore recognized the transcendent merit
        of Japanese decorative art. It was however somewhat remarkable that
        the public at large should come so universally to recognize it, and
        in so short a time. Not only our own commercial nation, but
        art-loving France, musical Germany, and even conservative England
        yielded to this invasion. Not that new designs were evolved by us; on
        the contrary, we were content to adopt Japanese designs outright,
        oftentimes with a mixture of incongruities that would have driven
        Japanese decorator stark mad. Designs appropriate for the metal
        mounting of a sword blazed out on our ceilings; motives fror a heavy
        bronze formed the theme for the decoration of friable pottery; and
        suggestions from light crape were woven into hot carpets to be
        trodden upon. Even with this mongrel admixture, it was a relief by
        any means to have driven out of our dwelling the nightmares and
        horrors of design we had before endured so meekly,‚Äîsuch objects, for
        example, as a child in dead brass, kneeling in perpetual supplication
        on a dead brass cushion, while adroitly balancing on its head a
        receptacle for kerosene oil; and a whole regiment of shapes equally
        monstrous. Our walls no longer assailed us with designs that wearied
        our eyes and exasperated our brains by their inanities. We were no
        longer doomed to wipe our feet on cupids, horns of plenty, restless
        tigers, or scrolls of architectural magnitudes. Under the benign
        influence of this new spirit it came to be realized that it was not
        always necessary to tear a flower in bits to recognize its decorative
        value; and that the simplest objects in Nature‚Äîa spray of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg xxvii]</span> bamboo, a
        pine cone, a cherry blossom‚Äîin the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right
        place</span></em> were quite sufficient to satisfy our craving for
        the beautiful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese
        exhibit at the Centennial exposition in Philadelphia came to us as a
        new revelation; and the charming onslaught of that unrivalled display
        completed the victory. It was then that the Japanese craze took firm
        hold of us. Books on Japan rapidly multiplied, especially books on
        decorative art; but it was found that such rare art could be properly
        represented only in the most costly fashion, and with plates of
        marvellous elaboration. What the Japanese were able to do with their
        primitive methods of block-printing and a few colors, required the
        highest genius of our artists and chromo-lithographers; and even then
        the subtile spirit which the artist sought for could not be
        caught.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more
        intelligent among our collectors soon recognized that the objects
        from Japan divided themselves into two groups,‚Äîthe one represented by
        a few objects having great intrinsic merit, with a refinement and
        reserve of decoration; the other group, characterized by a more
        florid display and less delicacy of treatment, forming by far the
        larger number, consisting chiefly of forms in pottery, porcelain,
        lacquer and metal work. These last were made by the Japanese
        expressly for the foreign market, many of them having no place in
        their economy, and with few exceptions being altogether too gaudy and
        violent to suit the Japanese taste. Our country became flooded with
        them; even the village grocery displayed them side by side with
        articles manufactured at home for the same class of customers, and
        equally out of place in the greater marts of the country. To us,
        however, these objects were always pretty, and were moreover so much
        cheaper, with all their high duties and importer's profits, than the
        stuff to which we had been accustomed, that they helped us out
        amazingly at every recurring Christmas. Of the better class of
        objects, nearly all of them were originally <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span> intended either for personal use
        or adornment,‚Äîsuch as clasps, little ivory carvings, sectional
        lacquer-boxes, fans, etc.; or mere objects of household use, such as
        hanging flower-holders, bronze and pottery vases, incense burners,
        lacquer cabinets, dishes, etc.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally great
        curiosity was awakened to know more about the social life of this
        remarkable people; and particularly was it desirable to know the
        nature of the house that sheltered such singular and beautiful works
        of art. In response to the popular demand, book after book appeared;
        but with some noteworth exceptions they repeated the same
        information, usually prefaced by an account of the more than special
        privileges accorded to their authors by the Japanese government,
        followed by history of the Japanese empire from its first emperor
        down the present time,‚Äîapparently concise enough, but interminable
        with its mythologies, wars, decays, restorations, etc. Then we had
        the record of an itinerary of a few weeks at some treaty port, or of
        a brief sojourn in the country, where, to illustrate the bravery of
        the author, imaginary dangers were conjured up; a wild guess at the
        ethnical enigma, erroneous conceptions of Japanese character and
        customs,‚Äîthe whole illustrated by sketches derived from previous
        works on the same subject, or from Japanese sources, often without
        due credit being given; and finally we were given a forecast of the
        future of Japan, with an account of the progress its public were
        making in adopting outside customs, with no warning of the acts of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hara-kiri</span></em> their arts would be
        compelled to perform in the presence of so many influences alien to
        their nature. As an illustration of this, could the force of
        absurdity go further than the attempt to introduce the Italian school
        of painting,‚Äîand this in the land of a Kano; or the melancholy act of
        a foreign employ√© of one of the colleges in Tokio, in inducing or
        compelling all its pupils to wear hot woollen Scotch caps,‚Äîconverting
        a lot of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span>
        handsome dark-haired boys, with graceful and picturesque dress, into
        a mob of ridiculous monkeys?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these books on
        Japan we look in vain for any but the most general description of
        what a Japanese home really is; even Rein's work, so apparently
        monographic, dismisses the house and garden in a few pages.<a id=
        "noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The
        present work is an attempt to fill this deficiency, by describing not
        only the variety of dwellings seen in Japan, but by specializing more
        in detail the variety of structure seen within the building.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following
        pages occasion has often led to criticism and comparison. Aside from
        any question of justice, it would seem as if criticism, to be of any
        value, should be comparative; that is to say, in any running
        commentary on Japanese ways and conditions the parallel ways and
        conditions of one's own people should be as frankly pointed out, or
        at least recognized. When <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg
        xxx]</span> one enters your city,‚Äîwhich is fairly clean and
        tidy‚Äîcomplains of its filthy streets, the assumption is that the
        streets of his own city are clean; and when these are found to dirty
        beyond measure, the value of the complaint or criticism is at once
        lost, and the author immediately set down as a wilful maligner.
        Either we should follow the dictum of the great moral Teacher, and
        hesitate to behold the mote in others' eyes or else in so doing we
        should consider the beam in our own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This duty,
        however, even to fair and unprejudiced minds, becomes a matter of
        great difficulty. It is extraordinary how blind one may be to the
        faults and crimes of his own people, and how reluctant to admit them.
        We sing heroic soldier-songs with energy and enthusiasm, and are
        amazed to find numbers in a Japanese audience disapproving, because
        of the bloody deeds celebrated in such an exultant way. We read daily
        our papers the details of the most blood-curdling crimes, and often
        of the most abhorrent and unnatural ones; and yet we make no special
        reflections on the conditions of society where such things are
        possible, or put ourselves much out of the way to arouse the people
        to a due sense of the degradation and stain on the community at large
        because of such things. But we go to another country and perhaps find
        a new species of vice; its novelty at once arrests our attention, and
        forthwith we howl at the enormity of the crime and the degradation of
        the nation in which such a crime could originate, send home the most
        exaggerated accounts, malign the people without stint, and then prate
        to them about Christian charity!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the study of
        another people one should if possible look through colorless glasses;
        though if one is to err in this respect, it were better that his
        spectacles should be rose-colored than grimed with the smoke of
        prejudice. The student of Ethnology as a matter of policy, if he can
        put himself in no more generous attitude, had better err in looking
        kindly and favorably <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg
        xxxi]</span> at a people whose habits and customs he is about to
        study. It is human nature the world over to resist adverse criticism;
        and when one is prowling about with his eyes darkened by the opaquest
        of uncorrected provincial glasses, he is repelled on all sides;
        nothing is accessible to him; he can rarely get more than a
        superficial glance at matters. Whereas, if he tries honestly to seek
        out the better attributes of a people, he is only too welcome to
        proceed with any investigation he wishes to make; even customs and
        ways that appear offensive are freely revealed to him, knowing that
        he will not wilfully distort and render more painful what is at the
        outset admitted on all hands to be bad.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We repeat that
        such investigation must be approached in a spirit of sympathy,
        otherwise much is lost or misunderstood. This is not only true as to
        social customs, but also as to studies in other lines of research as
        well. Professor Fenollosa, the greatest authority on Japanese
        pictorial art, says most truthfully that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúit
        is not enough to approach these delicate children of the spirit with
        the eye of mere curiosity, or the cold rigid standard of an alien
        school. One's heart must be large enough to learn to love, as the
        Japanese artist loves, before the veil can be lifted to the full
        splendor of their hidden beauties.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this spirit I
        have endeavored to give an account of Japanese homes and their
        surroundings. I might have dealt only with the huts of the poorest,
        with the squalor of their inmates, and given a meagre picture of
        Japanese life; or a study might have been made of the homes of the
        wealthy exclusively, which would have been equally one-sided. It
        seemed to me, however, that a description of the homes of the middle
        classes, with occasional reference to those of the higher and lower
        types, would perhaps give a fairer picture of the character and
        structure of Japanese homes and houses, than had I pursued either of
        the other courses. I may have erred in looking through spectacles
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxii">[pg xxxii]</span> tinted with
        rose; but if so, I have no apology to make. Living for some time
        among a people with whom I have had only the most friendly relations,
        and to whom I still owe a thousand debts of gratitude, it would be
        only a contemptible and jaundiced temperament that could under such
        circumstances write otherwise than kindly, or fail to make generous
        allowance for what appear to others as grave faults and
        omissions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
        Japanese houses, there are many features not to my liking; and in the
        ordinary language of travellers I might speak of these houses as huts
        and hovels, cold and cheerless, etc., and give such a generic
        description of them as would include under one category all the
        houses on the Pacific coast from Kamtchatka to Java. Faults these
        houses have; and in criticising them I have endeavored to make my
        reflections comparative; and I have held up for comparison much that
        is objectionable in our own houses, as well as the work done by our
        own artisans. But judging from the rage and disgust expressed in
        certain English publications, where one writer speaks of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúmuch of the work for wage as positively
        despicable,‚Äù</span> and another of the miseries entailed by the
        unscientific builder, my comparison may legitimately extend to
        England also.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
        volume the attempt has been made to describe the Japanese house and
        its immediate surroundings in general and in detail. No one realizes
        better than the author the meagreness in certain portions of this
        work. It is believed, however, that with the many illustrations, and
        the classification of the subject-matter, much will be made clear
        that before was vague. The figures are in every case fac-similes by
        one of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxiii">[pg
        xxxiii]</span> relief processes of the author's pen-and-ink drawings,
        and with few exceptions are from his own sketches made on the spot;
        so that whatever they lack in artistic merit, they make up in being
        more or less accurate drawings of the objects and features depicted.
        The material has been gleaned from an illustrated daily journal, kept
        by the author during three successive residences in that delightful
        country, embracing travels by land from the northwest coast of Yezo
        to the southernmost parts of Satsuma.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The openness and
        accessibility of the Japanese house are a distinguishing feature of
        Japan; and no foreigner visits that country without bringing away
        delightful memories of the peculiarly characteristic dwellings of the
        Japanese. On the occasion of the author's last visit to Japan he also
        visited China, Anam, Singapore, and Java, and made studies of the
        houses of these various countries, with special reference to the
        Japanese house and its possible affinities elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A BIRD'S-EYE view
        of a large city in Japan presents an appearance quite unlike that
        presented by any large assemblage of buildings at home. A view of
        Tokio, for example, from some elevated point reveals a vast sea of
        roofs,‚Äîthe gray of the shingles and dark slate-color of the tiles,
        with dull reflections from their surfaces, giving a sombre effect to
        the whole. The even expanse is broken here and there by the
        fire-proof buildings, with their ponderous tiled roofs and ridges and
        pure white or jet-black walls. These, though in color adding to the
        sombre appearance, form, with the exception of the temples, one of
        the most conspicuous features in the general monotony. The temples
        are indeed conspicuous, as they tower far above the pigmy dwellings
        which surround them. Their great black roofs, with massive ridges and
        ribs, and grand sweeps and white or red gables, render them striking
        objects from whatever point they are viewed. Green <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span> masses of tree-foliage
        springing from the numerous gardens add some life to this gray sea of
        domiciles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a curious
        sight to look over a vast city of nearly a million inhabitants, and
        detect no chimney with its home-like streak of blue smoke. There is
        of course no church spire, with its usual architectural inanities.
        With the absence of chimneys and the almost universal use of charcoal
        for heating purposes, the cities have an atmosphere of remarkable
        clearness and purity; so clear, indeed, is the atmosphere that one
        may look over the city and see distinctly revealed the minuter
        details of the landscape beyond. The great sun-obscuring canopy of
        smoke and fumes that forever shroud some of our great cities is a
        feature happily unknown in Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having got such a
        bird's-eye view of one city, we have seen them all,‚Äîthe minor
        variations consisting, for the most part, in the inequalities of the
        sites upon which they rest. A view of Kioto, for example, as seen
        from some high point, is remarkably beautiful and varied, as the
        houses creep out between the hills that hem it in. In Nagasaki the
        houses literally rise in tiers from the water's edge to the hills
        immediately back, there to become blended with the city of the dead
        which caps their summits. A view of Nagasaki from the harbor is one
        of surpassing interest and beauty. Other large cities, such as
        Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Nagoya present the same uniform level
        of roofs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The compact way in
        which in the cities and towns the houses are crowded together, barely
        separated by the narrow streets and lanes which cross like threads in
        every direction, and the peculiarly inflammable material of which
        most of the buildings are composed, explain the lightning-like
        rapidity with which a conflagration spreads when once fairly under
        way.</p>

        or more. Rarely ever does one see a cross street or lane, or
        evidences of compactness, save that near the centre of this long
        street the houses and shops often abut, while those at the end of the
        streets have ample space between them. Some villages, which from
        their situation have no chance of expanding, become densely crowded:
        such for example is the case of Enoshima, near Yokohama, wherein the
        main street runs directly from the shore, by means of a series of
        steps at intervals, to a flight of stone steps, which lead to the
        temples and shrines at the summit of the island. This street is
        flanked on both sides by hills; and the ravine, of which the street
        forms the central axis, is densely crowded with houses, the narrowest
        of alley-ways leading to the houses in the rear. A fire once started
        would inevitably result in the destruction of every house in the
        village.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a curious
        fact that one may ride long distances in the country without passing
        a single dwelling, and then abruptly enter a village. The entrance to
        a village is often marked by a high mound of earth on each side of
        the road, generally surmounted by a tree; or perhaps the evidences of
        an old barrier are seen in the remains of gate-posts or a stone-wall.
        Having passed through the village one enters the country again, with
        its rice-fields and cultivated tracts, as abruptly as he had left it.
        The villages vary greatly in their appearance: some are extremely
        trim and pretty, with neat flower-plats in front of the houses, and
        an air of taste and comfort everywhere apparent; other villages
        present marked evidences of poverty, squalid houses with dirty
        children swarming about them. Indeed, the most striking contrasts are
        seen between the various villages one passes through in a long
        overland trip in Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is difficult to
        imagine a more dreary and dismal sight than the appearance of some of
        these village streets on a rainy night. No brightly-lighted window
        cheers the traveller; only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg
        5]</span> lines of light glimmer through the chinks of the wooden
        shutters with which every house is closed at night. On pleasant
        evenings when the paper screens alone are closed, a ride through a
        village street is often rendered highly amusing by the grotesque
        shadow-pictures which the inmates are unconsciously projecting in
        their movements to and fro.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cities the
        quarters for the wealthier classes are not so sharply defined as with
        us, though the love for pleasant outlooks and beautiful scenery tends
        to enhance the value of certain districts, and consequently to bring
        together the wealthier classes. In nearly all the cities, however,
        you will find the houses of the wealthy in the immediate vicinity of
        the habitations of the poorest. In Tokio one may find streets, or
        narrow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span> alleys,
        lined with a continuous row of the cheapest shelters; and here dwell
        the poorest people. Though squalid and dirty as such places appear to
        the Japanese, they are immaculate in comparison with the unutterable
        filth and misery of similar quarters in nearly all the great cities
        of Christendom. Certainly a rich man in Japan would not, as a general
        thing, buy up the land about his house to keep the poorer classes at
        a distance, for the reason that their presence would not be
        objectionable, since poverty in Japan is not associated with the
        impossible manners of a similar class at home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before proceeding
        with a special description of Japanese homes, a general description
        of the house may render the chapters that are to follow a little more
        intelligible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first sight of
        a Japanese house,‚Äîthat is, a house of the people,‚Äîis certainly
        disappointing. From the infinite variety and charming character of
        their various works of art, as we had seen them at home, we were
        anticipating new delights and surprises in the character of the
        house; nor were we on more intimate acquaintance to be disappointed.
        As an American familiar with houses of certain types, with conditions
        among them signifying poverty and shiftlessness, and other conditions
        signifying refinement and wealth, I was not competent to judge the
        relative merits of a Japanese house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first sight,
        then, of a Japanese house is disappointing; it is unsubstantial in
        appearance, and there is a meagreness of color. Being unpainted, it
        suggests poverty; and this absence of paint, with the gray and often
        rain-stained color of the boards, leads one to compare it with
        similar unpainted buildings at home,‚Äîand these are usually barns and
        sheds in the country, and the houses of the poorer people in the
        city. With one's eye accustomed to the bright contrasts of American
        houses with their white, or light, painted surfaces; rectangular
        windows, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span> black from
        the shadows within, with glints of light reflected from the glass;
        front door with its pretentious steps and portico; warm red chimneys
        surmounting all, and a general trimness of appearance outside, which
        is by no means always correlated with like conditions within,‚Äîone is
        too apt at the outset to form a low estimate of a Japanese house. An
        American finds it difficult indeed to consider such a structure as a
        dwelling, when so many features are absent that go to make up a
        dwelling at home,‚Äîno doors or windows such as he had been familiar
        with; no attic or cellar; no chimneys, and within no fire-place, and
        of course no customary mantle; no permanently enclosed rooms; and as
        for furniture, no beds or tables, chairs or similar articles,‚Äîat
        least, so it appears at first sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the chief
        points of difference in a Japanese house as compared with ours lies
        in the treatment of partitions and outside walls. In our houses these
        are solid and permanent; and when the frame is built, the partitions
        form part of the framework. In the Japanese house, on the contrary,
        there are two or more sides that have no permanent walls. Within,
        also, there are but few partitions which have similar stability; in
        their stead are slight sliding screens which run in appropriate
        grooves in the floor and overhead. These grooves mark the limit of
        each room. The screens may be opened by sliding them back, or they
        may be entirely removed, thus throwing a number of rooms into one
        great apartment. In the same way the whole side of a house may be
        flung open to sunlight and air. For communication between the rooms,
        therefore, swinging doors are not necessary. As a substitute for
        windows, the outside screens, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em>
        are covered with white paper, allowing the light to be diffused
        through the house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where external
        walls appear they are of wood unpainted, or painted black; and if of
        plaster, white or dark slate colored. In certain classes of buildings
        the outside wall, to a height of several <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page8">[pg 8]</span> feet from the ground, and sometimes even the
        entire wall, may be tiled, the interspaces being pointed with white
        plaster. The roof may be either lightly shingled, heavily tiled, or
        thickly thatched. It has a moderate pitch, and as a general thing the
        slope is not so steep as in our roofs. Nearly all the houses have a
        verandah, which is protected by the widely-overhanging eaves of the
        roof, or by a light supplementary roof projecting from beneath the
        eaves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While most houses
        of the better class have a definite porch and vestibule, or
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">genka,</span></em> in houses of the poorer class
        this entrance is not separate from the living room; and since the
        interior of the house is accessible from two or three sides, one may
        enter it from any point. The floor is raised a foot and a half or
        more from the ground, and is covered with thick straw mats,
        rectangular in shape, of uniform size, with sharp square edges, and
        so closely fitted that the floor upon which they rest is completely
        hidden. The rooms are either square or rectangular, and are made with
        absolute reference to the number of mats they are to contain. With
        the exception of the guest-room few rooms have projections or bays.
        In the guest-room there is at one side a more or less deep recess
        divided into two bays by a slight partition; the one nearest the
        verandah is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma.</span></em> In this place hang one or
        more pictures, and upon its floor, which is slightly raised above the
        mats, rests a flower vase, incense burner, or some other object. The
        companion bay has shelves and a low closet. Other rooms also may have
        recesses to accommodate a case of drawers or shelves. Where closets
        and cupboards occur, they are finished with sliding screens instead
        of swinging doors. In tea-houses of two stories the stairs, which
        often ascend from the vicinity of the kitchen, have beneath them a
        closet; and this is usually closed by a swinging door.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The privy is at
        one corner of the house, at the end of the verandah; sometimes there
        are two at diagonal corners of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page9">[pg 9]</span> house. In the poorer class of country houses
        the privy is an isolated building with low swinging door, the upper
        half of the door-space being open.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In city houses the
        kitchen is at one side or corner of the house; generally in an L,
        covered with a pent roof. This apartment is often towards the street,
        its yard separated from other areas by a high fence. In the country
        the kitchen is nearly always under the main roof. In the city few
        out-buildings such as sheds and barns are seen. Accompanying the
        houses of the better class are solid, thick-walled, one or two
        storied, fire-proof buildings called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> in
        which the goods and chattels are stored away at the time of a
        conflagration. These buildings, which are known to the foreigners as
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgodowns,‚Äù</span> have one or two small
        windows and one door, closed by thick and ponderous shutters. Such a
        building usually stands isolated from the dwelling, though often in
        juxtaposition; and sometimes, though rarely, it is used as a
        domicile.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the gardens of
        the better classes summer-houses and shelters of rustic appearance
        and diminutive proportions are often seen. Rustic arbors are also to
        be seen in the larger gardens. Specially constructed houses of quaint
        design and small size are not uncommon; in these the ceremonial
        tea-parties take place. High fences, either of board or bamboo, or
        solid walls of mud or tile with stone foundations, surround the house
        or enclose it from the street. Low rustic fences border the gardens
        in the suburbs. Gateways of various styles, some of imposing design,
        form the entrances; as a general thing they are either rustic and
        light, or formal and massive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever is
        commonplace in the appearance of the house is towards the street,
        while the artistic and picturesque face is turned towards the garden,
        which may be at one side or in the rear of the house,‚Äîusually in the
        rear. Within these plain and unpretentious houses there are often to
        be seen marvels of exquisite carving, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page10">[pg 10]</span> and the perfection of cabinet work; and
        surprise follows surprise, as one becomes more fully acquainted with
        the interior finish of these curious and remarkable dwellings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the sections
        which are to follow, an attempt will be made by description and
        sketches to convey some idea of the details connected with the
        structure and inside finish of the Japanese house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no object
        in Japan that seems to excite more diverse and adverse criticism
        among foreigners than does the Japanese house; it is a constant
        source of perplexity and annoyance to most of them. An Englishman
        particularly, whom Emerson says he finds <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto
        be him of all men who stands firmest in his shoes,‚Äù</span> recognizes
        but little merit in the apparently frail and perishable nature of
        these structures. He naturally dislikes the anomaly of a house of the
        lightest description oftentimes sustaining a roof of the most
        ponderous character, and fairly loathes a structure that has no
        king-post, or at least a queen-post, truss; while the glaring
        absurdity of a house that persists in remaining upright without a
        foundation, or at least without his kind of a foundation, makes him
        furious. The mistake made by most writers in criticising Japanese
        house-structure, and indeed many other matters connected with that
        country, is that these writers do not regard such matters from a
        Japanese stand-point. They do not consider that the nation is poor,
        and that the masses are in poverty; nor do they consider that for
        this reason a Japanese builds such a house as he can afford, and one
        that after all is as thoroughly adapted to his habits and wants as
        ours is to our habits and wants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The observation of
        a Japanese has shown him that from generation to generation the
        houses of his people have managed to sustain themselves; and if in
        his travels abroad he has chanced to visit England, he will probably
        recall the fact that he saw <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg
        11]</span> more dilapidated tenements, tumble-down shanties,
        broken-backed farm-houses, cracked walls, and toppling fences in a
        single day in that virtuous country where there are no typhoons or
        earthquakes, than he would see in a year's travel in his own
        country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one of these
        foreign critical writers contemplates the framework of a Japanese
        house, and particularly the cross-beams of the roof, and finds no
        attempt at trussing and bracing, he is seized with an eager desire to
        go among these people as a missionary of trusses and braces,‚Äîit is so
        obvious that much wood might be saved! In regard to the Japanese
        house-frame, however, it is probable that the extra labor of
        constructing braces and trusses would not compensate for the
        difference saved in the wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rein, in his
        really admirable book on Japan, says <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
        Japanese house lacks chiefly solidity and comfort.‚Äù</span> If he
        means comfort for himself and his people, one can understand him; if
        he means comfort for the Japanese, then he has not the faintest
        conception of the solid comfort a Japanese gets out of his house.
        Rein also complains of the evil odors of the closet arrangements,
        though his complaints refer more particularly to the crowded inns,
        which are often in an exceedingly filthy condition as regards these
        necessary conveniences,‚Äîand one is led to inquire what the Japanese
        would think of similar features in Germany, where in the larger
        cities the closet may be seen opening directly into the front hall,
        and in some cases even from the dining-room! Bad as some of these
        conditions are in Japan, they are mild in comparison with like
        features in Germany. The filthy state of the larger cities, in this
        respect, may be indicated by the fact that the death-rate of Munich a
        few years ago was forty-four, and Kaulbach died of cholera in that
        city in mid-winter! Indeed, the presence of certain features in every
        bed-chamber at home and abroad are looked upon as surpassingly filthy
        by every Japanese,‚Äîas they truly are.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page12">[pg 12]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rein and other
        writers speak of the want of privacy in Japanese dwellings,
        forgetting that privacy is only necessary in the midst of vulgar and
        impertinent people,‚Äîa class of which Japan has the minimum, and the
        so-called civilized races‚Äîthe English and American particularly‚Äîhave
        the maximum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For my part, I
        find much to admire in a Japanese house, and some things not to my
        comfort. The sitting posture on the floor is painful until one gets
        accustomed to it; and, naturally, I find that our chairs are painful
        to the Japanese, until they become accustomed to them. I found the
        Japanese house in winter extremely cold and uncomfortable; but I
        question whether their cold rooms in winter are not more conducive to
        health than are our apartments with our blistering stoves, hot
        furnaces or steam-heaters; and as to the odors arising from the
        closet in certain country inns, who does not recall similar offensive
        features in many of our country inns at home, with the addition of
        slovenly yards and reeking piggeries? I question, too, whether these
        odors are more injurious to the health than is the stifling air from
        a damp and noisome cellar, which not only filters through our floors,
        but is often served to us hot through scorching furnaces. Whittier's

        answers admirably the purposes for which it was intended. A
        fire-proof building is certainly beyond the means of a majority of
        this people, as, indeed, it is with us; and not being able to build
        such a dwelling, they have from necessity gone to the other extreme,
        and built a house whose very structure enables it to be rapidly
        demolished in the path <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
        13]</span> of a conflagration. Mats, screen-partitions, and even the
        board ceilings can be quickly packed up and carried away. The roof is
        rapidly denuded of its tiles and boards, and the skeleton framework
        left makes but slow fuel for the flames. The efforts of the firemen
        in checking the progress of a conflagration consist mainly in tearing
        down these adjustable structures; and in this connection it may be
        interesting to record the curious fact that oftentimes at a fire the
        streams are turned, not upon the flames, but upon the men engaged in
        tearing down the building!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The improvements,
        however, that are imperatively demanded in Japanese house-structure
        are such modifications as shall render the building less inflammable.
        While these inflammable houses may be well enough in the suburbs or
        in country villages, they are certainly quite out of place in cities;
        and here, indeed, the authorities are justified in imposing such
        restrictions as shall not bear too heavily upon the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese
        should clearly understand that insuperable difficulties are to be
        encountered in any attempt to modify their style of dwellings, and
        that many of such proposed modifications are neither judicious nor
        desirable. That slight changes for safety may be effected, however,
        there can be no doubt. Through the agency of science, means may be
        found by which outside woodwork may be rendered less
        inflammable,‚Äîeither by fire-proof paint or other devices.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mean path of
        Tokio conflagrations has been ingeniously worked out by Professor
        Yamakawa, from data extending back two hundred years; and in this
        path certain areas might be left open with advantage. Fire-proof
        blocks in foreign style, such as now exist on the Ginza, may be
        ultimately constructed in this path. Since the last great
        conflagration, the Tokio authorities have specified certain districts
        within which shingled roofs shall not be made; and where such roofs
        existed, the authorities have compelled the substitution of tin,
        zinc, or tiled roofs. Above all, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page14">[pg 14]</span> let there be a reorganization, under
        Government, of the present corrupt fire-brigades. Such changes will
        certainly lead to good results; but as to altering the present plan
        of house-building and present modes of living, it is not only
        impracticable but well-nigh impossible. If such changes are effected,
        then will perish many of the best features of true Japanese art,
        which has been the surprise and admiration of Western nations, and of
        which in the past they have been the unwitting cause of the
        modification and degradation it has already undergone.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The frame-work of
        an ordinary Japanese dwelling is simple and primitive in structure;
        it consists of a number of upright beams which run from the ground to
        the transverse beams and inclines of the roof above. The vertical
        framing is held together either by short strips which are let in to
        appropriate notches in the uprights to which the bamboo lathing is
        fixed, or by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span>
        longer strips of wood which pass through mortises in the uprights and
        are firmly keyed or pinned into place (<a href="#myfig004" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 4</span></a>). In larger
        houses these uprights are held in position by a frame-work near the
        ground. There is no cellar or excavation beneath the house, nor is
        there a continuous stone foundation as with us. The uprights rest
        directly, and without attachment, upon single uncut or rough-hewn
        stones, these in turn resting upon others which have been solidly
        pounded into the earth by means of a huge wooden maul worked by a
        number of men (<a href="#myfig005" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 5</span></a>). In this way the house is perched
        upon these stones, with the floor elevated at least a foot and a half
        or two feet above the ground. In some cases the space between the
        uprights is boarded up; this is generally seen in Kioto houses. In
        others the wind has free play beneath; and while this exposed
        condition renders the house much colder and more uncomfortable in
        winter, the inmates are never troubled by the noisome air of the
        cellar, which, as we have said, too often <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page16">[pg 16]</span> infects our houses at home. Closed wooden
        fences of a more solid character are elevated in this way; that is,
        the lower rail or sill of the fence rests directly upon stones placed
        at intervals apart of six or eight feet. The ravages of numerous
        ground-insects, as well as larvae, and the excessive dampness of the
        ground at certain seasons of the year, render this method of building
        a necessity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The accurate way
        in which the base of the uprights is wrought to fit the inequalities
        of the stones upon which they rest, is worthy of notice. In the
        Emperor's garden we saw a two-storied house finished in the most
        simple and exquisite manner. It was, indeed, like a beautiful
        cabinet, though disfigured by a bright-colored foreign carpet on its
        lower floor. The uprights of this structure rested on large oval
        beach-worn stones buried endwise in the ground; and upon the smooth
        rounded portions of the stones, which projected above the level of
        the ground to a height of ten inches or more, the uprights had been
        most accurately fitted (<a href="#myfig006" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 6</span></a>). The
        effect was extremely light and buoyant, though apparently insecure to
        the last degree; yet this building had not only withstood a number of
        earthquake shocks, but also the strain of severe typhoons, which
        during the summer months sweep over Japan with such violence. If the
        building be very small, then the frame consists of four corner-posts
        running to the roof. In dwellings having a frontage of two or more
        rooms, other uprights occur between the corner-posts. As the rooms
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span> increase in
        number through the house, uprights come in the corners of the rooms,
        against which the sliding-screens, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em>
        abut. The passage of these uprights through the room to the roof
        above gives a solid constructive appearance to the house. When a
        house has a verandah,‚Äîand nearly every house possesses this feature
        on one or more of its sides,‚Äîanother row of uprights starts in a line
        with the outer edge of the verandah. Unless the verandah be very
        long, an upright at each end is sufficient to support the
        supplementary roof which shelters it. These uprights support a
        crossbeam, upon which the slight rafters of the supplementary roof
        rest.</p>

        the house, and run out to support the overhanging eaves. The larger

        irregular-shaped beams worked into the construction of a frame, often
        for their quaint effects (<a href="#myfig007" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a narrow
        house, if the roof be a gable, a central upright at each end of the
        building gives support to the ridge-pole from which the rafters run
        to the eaves (<a href="#myfig008" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 8</span></a>). If the building be wide, a
        transverse beam traverses the end of the building on a level with the
        eaves, supported at intervals by uprights from the ground; and upon
        this short uprights rest, supporting <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page19">[pg 19]</span> another transverse beam above, and often
        three or more tiers are carried nearly to the ridge. Upon these
        supports rest the horizontal beams which run parallel with the
        ridge-pole, and which are intended to give support to the rafters
        (<a href="#myfig009" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of a

        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 10</span></a>).
        Here a stout stick of timber runs from one end of the house to the
        other on a vertical line with the ridge-pole, and on a level with the
        eaves. This stick is always crowning, in order to give additional
        strength. A few thick uprights start from this to support the
        ridge-pole above; from these uprights beams run to the eaves; these
        are mortised into the uprights, but at different levels on either
        side in order not to weaken the uprights by the mortises. From these
        beams run short supports to the horizontal rafters above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The roof, if it be
        of tile or thatch, represents a massive weight,‚Äîthe tiles being thick
        and quite heavy, and always bedded in a thick layer of mud. The
        thatch, though not so heavy, often becomes so after a long rain. The
        roof-framing consequently has oftentimes to support a great weight;
        and though in its structure looking weak, or at least primitive in
        design, yet experience must have taught the Japanese carpenter that
        their methods were not only the simplest and most economical, but
        that they answered all requirements. One is amazed <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span> to see how many firemen can
        gather upon such a roof without its yielding. I have seen massive
        house-roofs over two hundred years old, and other frame structures of
        a larger size and of far greater age, which presented no visible
        signs of weakness. Indeed, it is a very unusual sight to see a
        broken-backed roof in Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beams that
        support the roofs of the fire-proof buildings, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> are
        usually rough-hewn and of ponderous dimensions. It would seem that
        here, at least, the foreign method of trussing might be an economy of
        material, besides giving much greater strength; and yet the expense
        of reducing these beams to proper dimensions, in the absence of
        saw-mills and other labor-saving machinery, with the added expense of
        iron rods, bolts, etc., would more than counterbalance the saving of
        material (<a href="#myfig011" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 11</span></a>). In <a href="#myfig011" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 11</span></a> is shown
        the universal method of roof support; namely, horizontal beams
        resting upon perpendicular walls, these in turn supporting vertical
        beams, which again give support to horizontal beams. That the
        Japanese have been familiar with the arch is seen in some of their
        old stone bridges; but they seem as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page21">[pg 21]</span> averse to using this principle in their
        house-architecture as were the Egyptians and Hindus. Fergusson, in
        his illustrated Handbook of Architecture, page xxxv, says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSo convinced were the Egyptians and Greeks
        of this principle, that they never used any other
        construction-expedient than a perpendicular wall or prop, supporting
        a horizontal beam; and half the satisfactory effect of their
        buildings arises from their adhering to this simple though expensive
        mode of construction. They were perfectly acquainted with the use of
        the arch and its properties, but they knew that its employment would
        introduce complexity and confusion into their designs, and therefore
        they wisely rejected it. Even to the present day the Hindus refuse to
        use the arch, though it has long been employed in their country by
        the Mahometans. As they quaintly express it, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äòan arch never sleeps;‚Äô</span> and it is true that by its
        thrusting and pressure it is always tending to tear a building to
        pieces. In spite of all counterpoises, whenever the smallest damage
        is done it hastens the ruin of a building which, if more simply
        constructed, might last for ages.‚Äù</span></p>

        mortised, the carpenter employs the most elaborate methods of
        mortising, of which there are many different formulas; yet I was
        informed by an American architect that their ways had no advantage as
        regards strength over those employed by our carpenters in doing the
        same work. There certainly seems to be much unnecessary work about
        many of their framing-joints. This same gentleman greatly admired the
        way in which the Japanese carpenter used the adze, and regretted that
        more of this kind of work was not done in America. In scarfing beams

        the uprights in a weak frame are supported by braces running from the
        ground at an acute angle, and held in place by wooden pins (<a href=
        "#myfig013" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        13</span></a>). Outside diagonal braces are sometimes met with as an
        ornamental feature. In the province of Ise one often sees a brace or
        bracket made out of an unhewn piece of timber, generally the proximal
        portion of some big branch. This is fastened to an upright, and
        appears to be a brace to hold up the end of a horizontal beam that
        projects beyond the eaves. These braces, however, are not even
        notched <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span> into the
        upright, but held in place by square wooden pins, and are of little
        use as a support for the building, though answering well to hold
        fishing-rods and other long poles, which find here convenient
        lodgment (<a href="#myfig014" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the village of
        Naruge, in Yamato, I noticed in an old inn a diagonal brace which
        made a pleasing ornamental feature to a solid frame-work, upon which
        rested a ponderous supplementary roof, heavily tiled. As the
        horizontal beams were supported by uprights beyond the ends of the
        brackets, no additional strength was gained by these braces in
        question, except as they might prevent fore and aft displacement.
        They were placed here solely for their ornamental appearance; or at
        least that was all the function they appeared to perform (<a href=

        a building is often revealed in the room in a way that would delight
        the heart of an Eastlake. Irregularities in the form of a stick are
        not looked upon as a hindrance in the construction of a building.
        From the way such crooked beams are brought into use, one is led to
        believe that the builder prefers them. The desire for rustic effects
        leads to the selection of odd-shaped timber. <a href="#myfig007"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 7</span></a>

        is sawed (<a href="#myfig016" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        rejected as liable to split. Second, in the round upright post that
        in most instances forms the front of the shallow partition that
        divides one end of the best room into two bays or recesses, a deep
        groove is cut, to admit the edge of the partition (fig. 17). By this
        treatment the wood is not so apt to check or split.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Special details of
        the room will be described in other chapters. It may be well to state
        here, however, that in the finish of the interior the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">daiku,</span></em> or
        carpenter, has finished his work, and a new set of workmen, the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sashi-mono-ya,</span></em> or cabinetmakers,
        come in,‚Äîthe rough framing and similar work being done by the
        carpenter proper. Great care is taken to secure wood that matches in
        grain and color; and this can be done only by getting material that
        has come from the same log. In the lumberyard one notices boards of
        uniform lengths tied up in bundles,‚Äîin fact tied up in precisely the
        same position that the wood <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg
        26]</span> occupied in the trunk before it was sawed into boards
        (<a href="#myfig018" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 18</span></a>). So with other wood material,‚Äîthe
        pieces are kept together in the same manner. One never sees in a
        lumber-yard a promiscuous pile of boards, but each log having been
        cut into boards is securely tied without displacement. As the rooms
        are made in sizes corresponding to the number of mats they are to
        contain, the beams, uprights, rafters, flooring-boards, boards for
        the ceiling, and all strips are got out in sizes to accommodate these
        various dimensions. The dimensions of the mats from one end of the
        Empire to the other are approximately three feet wide and six feet
        long; and these are fitted compactly on the floor. The architect
        marks on his plan the number of mats each room is to contain,‚Äîthis
        number defining the size of the room; hence the lumber used must be
        of definite lengths, and the carpenter is sure to find these lengths
        at the lumber-yard. It follows from this that but little waste occurs
        in the construction of a Japanese house. Far different is it with us
        in our extravagant and senseless methods of house-building. In our
        country, a man after building a wooden house finds his cellar and
        shed choked to repletion with the waste of his new house, and for a
        year or more at least has the grim comfort of feeding <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span> his fireplaces and kitchen
        stove with rough and finished woods which have cost him at the rate
        of four to eight cents per square foot!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ordinary
        ceiling in a Japanese house consists of wide thin boards, with their
        edges slightly overlapping. These boards at first sight appear to be
        supported by narrow strips of wood like slender beams, upon which the
        boards rest (<a href="#myfig096" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 96</span></a>). On reflection, however, it soon
        becomes apparent that these diminutive cross-beams, measuring in
        section an inch square or less, are altogether inadequate to support
        the ceiling, thin and light as the boards composing it really are. As
        one examines the ceiling, he finds no trace of pin or nail, and
        finally comes to wonder how the strips and boards are held in place,
        and why the whole ceiling does not sag.<a id="noteref_5" name=
        "noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> The
        explanation is that the strips upon which the boards are to rest are
        first stretched across the room at distances apart varying from ten
        to eighteen <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span>
        inches. The ends of these strips are supported by a moulding which is
        secured to the uprights of the wall. In cheap houses this moulding in
        section is angular; notches are cut in the uprights, and into these
        notches the sharp edge of the angular moulding rests and is secured
        (<a href="#myfig019" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 19</span></a>). The moulding is cut in this way to
        economize material. The strips having been adjusted, they are brought
        to a uniform level, but crowning slightly,‚Äîthat is, the centre is a
        little higher than the sides,‚Äîand are held in place either by a long
        board being placed temporarily beneath them, and propped up from the
        floor below; or else a long stick is placed beneath them, which is
        supported by a stout string from the rafters above (<a href=
        "#myfig020" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        20</span></a>). A low staging is then erected on the floor (the stud
        of the room rarely being over seven or eight feet); and the carpenter
        standing between the cross-strips, while elevated upon the staging,
        adjusts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span> the
        boards, one after the other, as they are passed up to him. The first
        board is placed against the wall, its edge fitting into a groove in
        the uprights; the next board is placed with its edge on the first
        board, and then nailed from above, with wooden or bamboo pegs, to the
        cross-strips. Thus it is that no nail or peg holes appear in the
        ceiling from below. Board after board is thus placed in position,
        each board lapping slightly over the one before it, and each in turn
        being slightly nailed to the strips. Each board has a deep wide
        groove ploughed out near its lapping edge, so that it bends very
        readily, and is thus brought down on the strip below. When the boards
        are carried in this manner half way across the room, a long, narrow,
        and thick piece of wood, say six feet in length, is placed on the
        last board laid, within an inch of its free edge and parallel to it.
        This piece is firmly nailed to the board upon which it rests, and
        into the cross-strips below. To the edge of this piece two or three
        long strips of wood are nailed vertically, the upper ends being
        nailed to the nearest rafters above. In this way is the ceiling
        suspended (<a href="#myfig021" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 21</span></a>). After this has been done, the
        remaining boards of the ceiling are placed in position and secured,
        one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span> after
        another, until the last is reached. To secure the last one in
        position the carpenter gets down from his position and adopts other
        methods. One method is to place this board on the last one secured
        and weight it with a few heavy stones, and then it is moved along
        from below and placed in position, where it remains quite as firm as
        if it had been lightly nailed (<a href="#myfig022" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 22</span></a>). In case
        there is a closet in the room or a recess, the last board is sawed
        into two or three lengths, and these are placed in position, one
        after another, and nailed from above to the cross-strips,‚Äîcare being
        taken to have these sections come directly over the cross-strips, so
        that from below the appearance is that of a continuous board. The
        sections are so arranged, as to length, that the last piece comes in
        the closet; and this may either be weighted with stones or left out
        altogether (<a href="#myfig023" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In long rooms one
        is oftentimes surprised to see boards of great width composing the
        ceiling, and apparently continuous from one end of the room to the
        other. What appears to be a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg
        31]</span> single board is in fact composed of a number of short
        lengths. The matching of the grain and color is accomplished by
        taking two adjacent boards in a bundle of boards, as previously
        figured and described, and placing them so that the same ends come
        together (<a href="#myfig024" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        have the joints come directly over the cross-pieces. The graining of
        the wood becomes continuous, each line of the grain and the color
        being of course duplicated and matched in the other board. Sometimes
        a number of lengths of board may be continued in this way, and yet
        from below the appearance is that of a single long piece.</p>

        bamboos are first nailed in a vertical position to the wooden strips,
        which are fastened from one upright to another; narrow strips of
        bamboo are then secured across these bamboos by means of coarse cords
        of straw, or bark fibre (<a href="#myfig004" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 4</span></a>). This
        partition is not unlike our own plaster-and-lath partition. Another
        kind of partition may be of boards; and against these small bamboo
        rods are nailed quite close together, and upon this the plaster is
        put. Considerable pains are taken as to the plastering. The plasterer
        brings to the house samples of various-colored <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span> sands and clays, so that one
        may select from these the color of his wall. A good coat of plaster
        comprises three layers. The first layer, called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">shita-nuri,</span></em> is composed of mud, in
        which chopped straw is mixed; a second layer, called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chu-nuri,</span></em>
        of rough lime, mixed with mud; the third layer, called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">uwa-nuri,</span></em>
        has the colored clay or sand mixed with lime,‚Äîand this last layer is
        always applied by a skilful workman. Other methods of treating this
        surface will be given in the chapter on interiors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
        partitions between the rooms consist entirely of light sliding
        screens, which will be specially described farther on. Often two or
        more sides of the house are composed entirely of these simple and
        frail devices. The outside permanent walls of a house, if of wood,
        are made of thin boards nailed to the frame horizontally,‚Äîas we lay
        clapboards on our houses. These may be more firmly held to the house
        by long strips nailed against the boards vertically. The boards may
        also be secured to the house vertically, and weather-strips nailed
        over the seams,‚Äîas is commonly the way with certain of our houses. In
        the southern provinces a rough house-wall is made of wide slabs of
        bark, placed vertically, and held in place by thin strips of bamboo
        nailed cross-wise. This style is common among the poorer houses in
        Japan; and, indeed, in the better class of houses it is often used as
        an ornamental feature, placed at the height of a few feet from the
        ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Outside plastered
        walls are also very common, though not of a durable nature. This kind
        of wall is frequently seen in a dilapidated condition. In Japanese
        picture-books this broken condition is often shown, with the bamboo
        slats exposed, as a suggestion of poverty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cities, the
        outside walls of more durable structures, such as warehouses, are not
        infrequently covered with square tiles, a board wall being first
        made, to which the tiles are secured by being nailed at their
        corners. These may be placed in diagonal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page33">[pg 33]</span> or horizontal rows,‚Äîin either case an
        interspace of a quarter of an inch being left between the tiles, and
        the seams closed with white plaster, spreading on each side to the
        width of an inch or more, and finished with a rounded surface. This
        work is done in a very tasteful and artistic manner, and the effect
        of the dark-gray tiles crossed by these white bars of plaster is very
        striking (<a href="#myfig025" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 25</span></a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the fire-proof
        buildings, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> are often used as
        dwelling‚Äîplaces, a brief mention of their structure may be proper
        here. These buildings are specially designed for fire-proof
        storehouses. They are generally two stories in height, with walls
        eighteen inches to two feet or more in thickness, composed of mud
        plastered on to a frame-work of great strength and solidity. The
        beams are closely notched, and bound with a coarse-fibred rope; and
        small bamboos are closely secured to the beams. Short coarse-fibred
        ropes, a foot in length, are secured in close rows to the crossbeams
        and uprights. All these preparations are made for the purpose of more
        securely holding the successive layers of mud <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span> to be applied. As a
        preliminary to this work a huge and ample staging is erected to
        completely envelop the building. The staging, indeed, forms a huge
        cage, and upon this straw mattings are hung so that the mud
        plastering shall not dry too quickly. This cage is sufficiently ample
        to allow the men to work freely around and beneath it. Layer after
        layer is applied, and a long time elapses between these applications,
        in order that each layer may dry properly. Two years or more are
        required in the proper construction of one of these fire-proof
        buildings. The walls having been finished, a coat of plaster, or a
        plaster mixed with lamp-black, is applied, and a fine polished
        surface, like black lacquer, is produced. This polished black surface
        is made by first rubbing with a cloth, then with silk, and finally
        with the hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A newly-finished
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kura</span></em> presents a remarkably solid and
        imposing appearance. The roofs are of immense thickness, with
        enormous ridges ornamented with artistic designs in stucco, and the
        ridges terminating with ornamental tiles in high-relief. The fine
        polish of these buildings soon becomes impaired, and they finally
        assume a dull black or slaty color; sometimes a coat of white plaster
        is applied. Upon the outside of the wall a series of long iron hooks
        are seen<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">;</span></em> these are to hold an adjustable
        wooden casing which is often used to cover the walls, and thus to
        protect them from the eroding action of the elements. These wooden
        casings are placed against the buildings, proper openings being left
        through which the iron hooks project, and long slender bars of wood
        stretch across the wall, held in place by the upturned ends of the
        iron hooks, and in turn holding the wooden casing in place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The windows of the
        buildings are small, and each is closed either by a sliding-door of
        great thickness and solidity, or by double-shutters swinging
        together. The edges of these shutters have a series of rabbets, or
        steps, precisely like those seen <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page35">[pg 35]</span> in the heavy doors of a bank-safe. At the
        time of a fire, additional precautions are taken by stopping up the
        chinks of these closed shutters with mud, which is always at hand,
        ready mixed for such an emergency. These buildings, when properly
        constructed, seem to answer their purpose admirably; and after a
        conflagration, when all the surrounding territory is absolutely
        flat;‚Äîfor there are no tottering chimneys or cavernous cellars and
        walls to be seen, as with us,‚Äîthese black, grimy <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kura</span></em>
        stand conspicuous in the general ruin. They do not all survive,
        however, as smoke is often seen issuing from some of them, indicating
        that, as in our own country, safes are not always fire-proof.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A somewhat
        extended experience with the common everyday carpenter at home leads
        me to say, without fear of contradiction, that in matters pertaining
        to their craft the Japanese carpenters are superior to American. Not
        only do they show their superiority in their work, but in their
        versatile ability in making new things. One is amazed to see how
        patiently a Japanese carpenter or cabinet-maker will struggle over
        plans, not only drawn in ways new and strange to him, but of objects
        equally new,‚Äîand struggle successfully. It is a notorious fact that
        most of the carpenters in our smaller towns and villages are utterly
        incompetent to carry out any special demand made upon them, outside
        the building of the conventional two-storied house and ordinary roof.
        They stand bewildered in the presence of a window-projection or
        cornice outside the prescribed ruts with which they and their fathers
        were familiar. Indeed, in most cases their fathers were not
        carpenters, nor will their children be; and herein alone the Japanese
        carpenter has an immense advantage over the American, for his trade,
        as well as other trades, have been perpetuated through generations of
        families. The little children have been brought up amidst the odor of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span> fragrant
        shavings,‚Äîhave with childish hands performed the duties of an
        adjustable vise or clamp; and with the same tools which when children
        they have handed to their fathers, they have in later days earned
        their daily rice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I see one of
        our carpenters' ponderous tool-chests, made of polished woods, inlaid
        with brass decorations, and filled to repletion with several hundred
        dollars' worth of highly polished and elaborate machine-made
        implements, and contemplate the work often done with them,‚Äîwith
        everything binding that should go loose, and everything rattling that
        should be tight, and much work that has to be done twice over, with
        an indication everywhere of a poverty of ideas,‚Äîand then recall the
        Japanese carpenter with his ridiculously light and flimsy tool-box
        containing a meagre assortment of rude and primitive
        tools,‚Äîconsidering the carpentry of the two people, I am forced to
        the conviction that civilization and modern appliances count as
        nothing unless accompanied with a moiety of brains and some little
        taste and wit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a very
        serious fact that now-a-days no one in our country is acquiring
        faithfully the carpenter's trade. Much of this lamentable condition
        of things is no doubt due to the fact that machine-work has
        supplanted the hand-work of former times.<a id="noteref_6" name=
        "noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> Doors,
        blinds, sashes, mouldings are now turned out by the cord and mile,
        and all done in such greedy haste, and with the greenest of lumber,
        that if it does not tumble to pieces in transportation it is sure to
        do so very soon after entering into the house-structure.
        Nevertheless, the miserable truth yet remains that any man who has
        nailed up a few boxes, or stood in front of a circular <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span> saw for a few months, feels
        competent to exercise all the duties of that most honorable
        craft,‚Äîthe building of a house.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
        interesting, in this connection, to mention a few of the principal
        tools one commonly sees in use among the Japanese carpenters. After
        having seen the good and serviceable carpentry, the perfect joints
        and complex mortises, done by good Japanese workmen, one is
        astonished to find that they do their work without the aid of certain
        appliances considered indispensable by similar craftsmen in our
        country. They have no bench, no vise, no spirit-level, and no
        bit-stock; and as for labor-saving machinery, they have absolutely
        nothing. With many places which could be utilized for water-power,
        the old country saw-mill has not occurred to them.<a id="noteref_8"
        name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> Their
        tools appear to be roughly made, and of primitive design, though
        evidently of the best-tempered steel. The only substitute for the
        carpenter's bench is a plank <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg
        38]</span> on the floor, or on two horses; a square, firm, upright
        post is the nearest approach to a bench and vise, for to this beam a
        block of wood to be sawed into pieces is firmly held (<a href=
        "#myfig026" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        26</span></a>). A big wooden wedge is bound firmly to the post with a
        stout rope, and this driven down with vigorous blows till it pinches
        the block which is to be cut into the desired proportions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In using many of
        the tools, the Japanese carpenter handles them quite differently from
        our workman; for instance, he draws the plane towards him instead of
        pushing it from him. The planes are very rude-looking implements.
        Their bodies, instead of being thick blocks of wood, are quite wide
        and thin (<a href="#myfig027" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 27</span></a>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">D, E),</span></em>
        and the blades are inclined at a greater angle than the blade in our
        plane. In some planes, however, the blade stands vertical; this is
        used in lieu of the steel scrapers in giving wood a smooth finish,
        and might be used with advantage by our carpenters as a substitute
        for the piece of glass or thin plate of steel with which they usually
        scrape the surface of the wood. A huge plane is often seen, five or
        six feet long. This plane, however, is fixed in an inclined position,
        upside down; that is, with the blade uppermost. The board, or piece
        to be planed, is moved back and forth upon it.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Draw-shaves are in
        common use. The saws are of various kinds, with teeth much longer
        than those of our saws, and cut in different ways. Some of these
        forms reminded me of the teeth seen in certain recently patented saws
        in the United States. Some saws have teeth on the back as well as on
        the front, one edge being used as a cross-cut saw (<a href=
        "#myfig027" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        27</span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">B, C).</span></em> The hand-saw, instead of
        having the curious loop-shaped handle made to accommodate only one
        hand as with us, has a simple straight cylindrical handle as long as
        the saw itself, and sometimes longer. Our carpenters engage one hand
        in holding the stick to be sawed, while driving the saw with the
        other hand; the Japanese carpenter, on the contrary, holds the piece
        with his foot, and stooping over, with his two hands drives the saw
        by quick and rapid cuts through the wood. This style of working and
        doing many other things could never be adopted in this country
        without an importation of Japanese backs. It was an extraordinary
        sight to see the attitudes these people <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page40">[pg 40]</span> assumed in doing work of various kinds. A
        servant girl, for example, in wiping up the floor or verandah with a
        wet cloth, does not get down on her knees to do her work, but bending
        over while still on her feet, she pushes the cloth back and forth,
        and thus in this trying position performs her task.</p>

        not unlike a hockey-stick (<a href="#myfig027" class=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">A).</span></em> In summer the carpenters work
        with the scantiest clothing possible, and nearly always barefooted.
        It is a startling sight to a nervous man to see a carpenter standing
        on a stick of timber, hacking away in a furious manner with this
        crooked-handled instrument having an edge as sharp as a razor, and
        taking off great chips of the wood within an inch of his naked toes.
        Never having ourselves seen a toeless carpenter, or one whose feet
        showed the slightest indication of his ever having missed the mark,
        we regarded as good evidence of the unerring accuracy with which they
        use this serviceable tool.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For drilling holes
        a very long-handled awl is used. The carpenter seizing the handle at
        the end, between the palms of his hands, and moving his hands rapidly
        back and forth, pushing down at the same time, the awl is made
        rapidly to rotate back and forth; as his hands gradually slip down on
        the handle he quickly seizes it at the upper end again, continuing
        the motion as before. One is astonished to see how rapidly holes are
        drilled in this simple, yet effective way. For large holes, augers
        similar to ours are used. Their chisel is also much like ours in
        shape. For nailing in places above the easy reach of both hands they
        use a hammer, one end of which is prolonged to a point; holding,
        then, a nail between the thumb and finger with the hammer grasped in
        the same hand, a hole is made in the wood with the pointed end of the
        hammer, the nail inserted and driven in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A portable

        "tei tei-emph"><span style=

        narrower than our square. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sumi-sashi</span></em> is a double-ended brush
        made out of fibrous wood, rounded at one end, and having a wide sharp
        edge at the other (<a href="#myfig029" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 29</span></a>). The
        carpenter always has with him a box containing cotton saturated with
        ink; by means of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sumi-sashi</span></em> and ink the carpenter can
        mark characters and signs with the rounded end, or fine black lines
        with the sharp edge. One, advantage attending this kind of a brush is
        that the carpenter can make one at a moment's notice. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sumi-tsubo</span></em>(<a href="#myfig030"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 30</span></a>,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">A,
        B</span></em>) is the substitute for our carpenter's chalk-line; it
        is made of wood, often curiously wrought, having at one end a cavity
        scooped out and filled with cotton saturated with ink, and the other
        end has a reel with a little crank. Upon the reel is wound a long
        cord, the free end of which passes through the cotton and out through
        a hole at the end of the instrument. To the end of the cord is
        secured an object resembling an awl. To make a line on a plank or
        board the awl is driven into the wood, the cord is unreeled, and in
        this act it becomes blackened with ink; by snapping the cord in the
        usual way, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span> a
        clear black line is left upon the surface of the wood. It is then
        quickly reeled up again by means of a little crank. This instrument
        is an improvement in every way over the chalk-line, as it is more
        convenient, and by its use a clear black line is left upon the wood,
        instead of the dim chalk-line which is so easily effaced. This
        implement is often used as a plumb-line by giving a turn to the cord
        about the handle, thus holding it firmly, and suspending the
        instrument by means of the awl.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By an examination
        of old books and pictures one gets an idea of the antiquity of many
        objects still in use in Japan. I was shown, at the house of a
        Japanese antiquary, a copy of a very old <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maki-mono</span></em>
        (a long scroll of paper rolled up like a roll of wall-paper, on which
        continuous stories or historical events are written or painted). This
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">maki-mono</span></em> in question was painted by
        Takakana, of Kioto, five hundred and seventy years ago, and
        represented the building of a temple, from the preliminary exercises
        to its completion. One sketch showed the carpenters at work hewing
        out the wood and making the frame. There were many men at work; a few
        were eating and drinking; tools were lying about. In all the tools
        represented in the picture,‚Äîof which there were chisels, mallets,
        hatchets, adzes, squares, and saws,‚Äîthere was no plane or long saw. A
        piece of timber was being cut longitudinally with a chisel. The
        square was the same as that in use to-day. The tool which seemed to
        take the place of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg
        44]</span> plane was similar to a tool still used by coopers, but I
        believe by no other class of workmen, though I remember to have seen
        a man and a boy engaged in stripping bark from a long pole with a
        tool similar to the one seen in the sketch (<a href="#myfig032"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        32</span></a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sumi-tsubo</span></em> was much more simple and
        primitive in form in those times, judging from the sketch given on
        page 42 (<a href="#myfig030" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 30</span></a>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">C).</span></em> A
        carpenter's tool-box is shown quite as small and light as similar
        boxes in use to-day. To the cover of this box (fig. 32) is attached a
        curious hand-saw with a curved edge. Large saws with curved edges,
        having handles at both ends, to be worked by two men, are in common
        use; but I have never seen a hand-saw of this shape. All the saws
        represented in the picture had the same curved edge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing is more to
        be commended than the strong, durable, and sensible way in which the
        Japanese carpenter erects his staging. The various parts of a staging
        are never nailed together, as this would not only weaken the pieces
        through which spikes and nails have been driven, but gradually impair
        its integrity. All the pieces, upright and transverse, are firmly
        tied together with tough, strong rope. The rope is wound about, again
        and again, in the tightest possible manner. Buddhist temples of lofty
        proportions are reared and finished, and yet one never hears of the
        frightful accidents that so often occur at home as the results of
        stagings giving way in the erection of similar lofty structures. How
        exceedingly dull and stupid it must appear to a Japanese carpenter
        when he learns that his Christian brother constructs a staging that
        is liable, sooner or later, to precipitate him to the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Writers on Japan
        have often commented upon the absence of any grand or imposing
        architectural edifices in that country; and they have offered in
        explanation, that in a country shaken by frequent earthquakes no
        stately structures or buildings of lofty proportions can endure.
        Nevertheless, many such structures do exist, and have existed for
        centuries,‚Äîas witness the old temples and lofty pagodas, and also the
        castles of the Daimios, notably the ones at Kumamoto and Nagoya. If
        the truth were known, it would be found that revolution and rebellion
        have been among the principal destructive agencies in nearly
        obliterating whatever may have once existed of grand architectural
        structures in Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aim√© Humbert finds
        much to admire in the castles of the Daimios, and says, with truth:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn general, richness of detail is less aimed
        at than the general effect resulting from the grandeur and harmony of
        the proportions of the buildings. In this respect some of the
        seigniorial residences of Japan deserve to figure among the
        architectural monuments of Eastern Asia.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to the
        architecture of Japan, as to other matters, one must put himself in
        an attitude of sympathy with her people, or at least he must become
        awakened to a sympathetic appreciation of their work and the
        conditions under which it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg
        46]</span> has arisen. Above all, he must rid himself of all
        preconceived ideas as to what a house should be, and judge the work
        of a Japanese builder solely from the Japanese stand-point.
        Architectural edifices, such as we recognize as architectural, do not
        exist outside her temples and castles. Some reason for this condition
        of things may be looked for in the fact that the vast majority of the
        Japanese are poor,‚Äîvery poor; and further, in the fact that the idea
        of co-operative buildings, with the exception of the Yashiki
        barracks, has never entered a Japanese mind,‚Äîeach family, with few
        exceptions, managing to have a house of its own. As a result of this,
        a vast number of the houses are shelters merely, and are such from
        necessity; though even among these poorer shelters little bits of
        temple architecture creep in,‚Äîquite as scanty, however, in that
        respect as are similar features in our two-storied wooden boxes at
        home, which may have a bit of Grecian suggestion in the window caps,
        or of Doric in the front door-posts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In considering the
        temples of the Japanese, moreover, one should take into account their
        methods of worship, and precisely what use the worshippers make of
        these remarkable edifices. And so with intelligent sympathy finally
        aroused in all these matters, they begin to wear a new aspect; and
        what appeared grotesque and unmeaning before, now becomes full of
        significance and beauty. We see that there is something truly
        majestic in the appearance of the broad and massive temples, with the
        grand upward sweep of their heavily-tiled roofs and deep-shaded
        eaves, with intricate maze of supports and carvings beneath; the
        whole sustained on colossal round posts locked and tied together by
        equally massive timbers. Certainly, to a Japanese the effect must be
        inspiring beyond description; and the contrast between these
        structures and the tiny and perishable dwellings that surround them
        renders the former all the more grand and impressive. Foreigners,
        though familiar with the cathedral architecture of Europe, must
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span> yet see much to
        admire in these buildings. Even in the smaller towns and villages,
        where one might least expect to find such structures, the traveller
        sometimes encounters these stately edifices. Their surroundings are
        invariably picturesque; no sterile lot, or worthless sand-hill
        outside the village, will suit these simple people, but the most
        charming and beautiful place is always selected as a site for their
        temples of worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may be
        said regarding the architecture of Japan, the foreigner, at least,
        finds it difficult to recognize any distinct types of architecture
        among the houses, or to distinguish any radical differences in the
        various kinds of dwellings he sees in his travels through the
        country. It may be possible that these exist, for one soon gets to
        recognize the differences between the ancient and modern house. There
        are also marked differences between the compact house of the merchant
        in the city and the country house; but as for special types of
        architecture that would parallel the different styles found in our
        country, there are none. Everywhere one notices minor details of
        finish and ornament which he sees more fully developed in the temple
        architecture, and which is evidently derived from this source; and if
        it can be shown, as it unquestionably can, that these features were
        brought into the country by the priests who brought one of the two
        great religions, then we can trace many features of architectural
        detail to their home, and to the avenues through which they came.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with
        the statement just made, that it is difficult to recognize any
        special types of architecture in Japanese dwellings, it may be
        interesting to mention that we found it impossible to get books in
        their language treating of house architecture. Doubtless books of
        this nature exist,‚Äîindeed, they must exist; but though the writer had
        a Japanese bookseller, and a number of intelligent friends among the
        Japanese, looking for such books, he never had the good fortune to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span> secure any. Books
        in abundance can be got treating of temple architecture, from the
        plans of the framing to the completed structure; also of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> or
        go-downs, gateways, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tori-i,</span></em> etc. Plans of buildings for
        their tea-ceremonies, and endless designs for the inside finish of a
        house,‚Äîthe recesses, book-shelves, screens, and indeed all the
        delicate cabinet-work,‚Äîare easily obtainable; but a book which shall
        show the plans and elevations of the ordinary dwelling the writer has
        never yet seen. A number of friends have given him the plans of their
        houses as made by the carpenter, but there were no elevations or
        details of outside finish represented. It would seem as if, for the
        ordinary houses at least, it were only necessary to detail in plan
        the number and size of the rooms, leaving the rest of the structure
        to be completed in any way by the carpenter, so long as he contrived
        to keep the rain out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there is no
        attempt at architectural display in the dwelling-houses of Japan the
        traveller is at least spared those miserable experiences he so often
        encounters in his own country, where to a few houses of good taste he
        is sure to pass hundreds of perforated wooden boxes with angular
        roofs and red chimneys unrelieved by a single moulding; and now and
        then to meet with one of those cupola-crowned, broad-brimmed,
        corinthian-columned abominations, as well as with other forms equally
        grotesque and equally offending good taste.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to the
        former somewhat isolated life of the different provinces, the style
        of building in Japan varies considerably; and this is more
        particularly marked in the design of the roof and ridge. Though the
        Japanese are conservative in many things concerning the house, it is
        worthy of note that changes have taken place in the house
        architecture within two hundred and fifty years; at all events,
        houses of the olden times have much heavier beams in their frame and
        wider planks in their structure, than have the houses of more recent
        times. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span> A probable
        reason is that wood was much cheaper in past times; or it is possible
        that experience has taught them that sufficiently strong houses can
        be made with lighter material.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese
        dwellings are always of wood, usually of one story and unpainted.
        Rarely does a house strike one as being specially marked or better
        looking than its neighbors; more substantial, certainly, some of them
        are, and yet there is a sameness about them which becomes wearisome.
        Particularly is this the case with the long, uninteresting row of
        houses that border a village street; their picturesque roofs alone
        save them from becoming monotonous. A closer study, however, reveals
        some marked differences between the country and city houses, as well
        as between those of different provinces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The country house,
        if anything more than a shelter from the elements, is larger and more
        substantial than the city house, and with its ponderous thatched roof
        and elaborate ridge is always picturesque. One sees much larger
        houses in the north,‚Äîroofs of grand proportions and an amplitude of
        space beneath, that farther south occurs only under the roofs of
        temples. We speak now of the houses of the better classes, for the
        poor farm-laborer and fisherman, as well as their prototypes in the
        city, possess houses that are little better than shanties, built, as
        a friend has forcibly expressed it, of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúchips, paper, and straw.‚Äù</span> But even these huts,
        clustered together as they oftentimes are in the larger cities, are
        palatial in contrast to the shattered and filthy condition of a like
        class of tenements in many of the cities of Christian countries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In travelling
        through the country the absence of a middle class, as indicated by
        the dwellings, is painfully apparent. It is true that you pass, now
        and then, large comfortable houses with their broad thatched roofs,
        showing evidences of wealth and abundance in the numerous <em class=

        outbuildings surrounding them; but where you find one of these you
        pass hundreds <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span>
        which are barely more than shelters for their inmates; and within,
        the few necessary articles render the evidences of poverty all the
        more apparent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the people
        that inhabit such shelters are very poor, they appear contented and
        cheerful notwithstanding their poverty. Other classes, who though not
        poverty-stricken are yet poor in every sense of the word, occupy
        dwellings of the simplest character. Many of the dwellings are often
        diminutive in size; and as one looks in at a tiny cottage containing
        two or three rooms at the most, the entire house hardly bigger than a
        good-sized room at home, and observes a family of three or four
        persons living quietly and in a cleanly manner in this limited space,
        he learns that in Japan, at least, poverty and constricted quarters
        are not always correlated with coarse manners, filth, and crime.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Country and city
        houses of the better class vary as greatly as with us,‚Äîthe one with
        its ponderous thatched roof and smoke-blackened interior, the other
        with low roof neatly tiled, or shingled, and the perfection of
        cleanliness within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Tokio, the
        houses that abut directly on the street have a close and prison-like
        aspect. The walls are composed of boards or plaster, and perforated
        with one or two small windows lightly barred with bamboo, or heavily
        barred with square wood-gratings. The entrance to one of these houses
        is generally at one corner, or at the side. The back of the house and
        one side, at least, have a verandah. I speak now of the better class
        of houses in the city, but not of the best houses, which almost
        invariably stand back from the street and are surrounded by
        gardens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The accompanying
        sketch (<a href="#myfig033" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 33</span></a>) represents a group of houses
        bordering a street in Kanda Ku, Tokio. The windows are in some cases
        projecting or hanging bays, and are barred with bamboo or square bars
        of wood. A sliding-screen covered with stout white paper takes the
        place of our glass-windows. Through <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page51">[pg 51]</span> these gratings the inmates of the house do
        their bargaining with the street venders. The entrance to these
        houses is usually by means of a gate common to a number. This
        entrance consists of a large gate used for vehicles and heavy loads,
        and by the side of this is a smaller gate used by the people.
        Sometimes the big gate has a large square opening in it, closed by a
        sliding-door or grating,‚Äîand through this the inmates have ingress
        and egress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The houses, if of
        wood, are painted black; or else, as is more usually the case, the
        wood is left in its natural state, and this gradually turns to a
        darker shade by exposure. When painted, a dead black is used; and
        this color is certainly agreeable to the eyes, though the heat-rays
        caused by this black surface become almost unendurable on hot days,
        and must add greatly to the heat and discomfort within the house.
        With a plastered outside wall the surface is often left white, while
        the frame-work of the building is painted black,‚Äîand this treatment
        gives it a decidedly funereal aspect.</p>

        "#myfig034" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        34</span></a> two other houses in the same street are shown, one
        having a two-storied addition in the rear. The entrance to this house
        is by means of a gate, which in the sketch is open. The farther house
        has the door on the street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not often
        that the streets are bordered by such well-constructed ditches on the
        side, as is represented in the last two figures; in these cases the
        ditches are three or four feet wide, with well-built stone-walls and
        stone or wooden bridges spanning them at the doors and gateways.
        Through these ditches the water is running, and though vitiated by
        the water from the kitchen and baths is yet sufficiently pure to
        support quite a number of creatures, such as snails, frogs, and even
        fishes. In the older city dwellings of the poorer classes a number of
        tenements often occur in a block, and the entrance is by means of a
        gateway common to all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
        revolution of 1868 there has appeared a new style of building in
        Tokio, in which a continuous low of tenements <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span> is under one roof, and each
        tenement has its own separate entrance directly upon the street.
        <a href="#myfig035" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 35</span></a> gives a sketch of a row of these
        tenements. These blocks, nearly always of one story, are now quite
        common in various parts of Tokio. In the rear is provided a small
        plot for each tenement, which may be used for a garden. People of
        small means, but by no means the poorer classes, generally occupy
        these dwellings. I was informed by an old resident of Tokio that only
        since the revolution have houses been built with their doors or main
        entrances opening directly on the street. This form of house is
        certainly convenient and economical, and is destined to be a common
        feature of house-building in the future.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the business
        streets similar rows of buildings are seen, though generally each
        shop is an independent building, abutting directly to the next; and
        in the case of all the smaller shops, and indeed of many of the
        larger ones, the dwelling and shop are one, the goods being displayed
        in the room on the street, while the family occupy the back rooms.
        While one is bartering at a shop, the whole front being open, he may
        often catch a glimpse of the family in the back room at dinner, and
        may look <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span> entirely
        through a building to a garden beyond. It is a source of amazement to
        a foreigner to find in the rear of a row of dull and sombre
        business-houses independent dwellings, with rooms of exquisite taste
        and cleanliness. I remember, in one of the busiest streets of Tokio,
        passing through a lithographer's establishment, with the inky presses
        and inky workmen in full activity, and coming upon the choicest of
        tiny gardens and, after crossing a miniature foot-bridge, to a house
        of rare beauty and finish. It is customary for the common merchant to
        live under the same roof with the shop, or in a closely contiguous
        building; though in Tokio, more than elsewhere, I was informed it is
        the custom among the wealthy merchants to have their houses in the
        suburbs of the city, at some distance from their place of
        business.</p>

        in <a href="#myfig036" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 36</span></a> is a city house of one of the better
        classes. The house stands on a new street, and the lot on one side is
        vacant; nevertheless, the house is surrounded on all sides by a high
        board-fence,‚Äîsince, with the open character of a Japanese house,
        privacy, if desired, can be secured only by high <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span> fences or thick hedges. The
        house is shown as it appears from the street. The front-door is near
        the gate, which is shown on the left of the sketch. There is here no
        display of an architectural front; indeed, there is no display
        anywhere. The largest and best rooms are in the back of the house;
        and what might be called a back-yard, upon which the kitchen opens,
        is parallel with the area in front of the main entrance to the house,
        and separated from it by a high fence. The second story contains one
        room, and this may be regarded as a guest-chamber. Access to this
        chamber is by means of a steep flight of steps, made out of thick
        plank, and unguarded by hand-rail of any kind. The roof is heavily
        tiled, while the walls of the house are outwardly composed of broad
        thin boards, put on vertically, and having strips of wood to cover
        the joints. A back view of this house is shown in <a href="#myfig037"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 37</span></a>.
        Here all the rooms open directly on the garden. Along the verandah
        are three rooms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span> balcony of the second story
        is covered by a light supplementary roof, from which hangs a bamboo
        screen to shade the room from the sun's rays. Similar screens are
        also seen hanging below.</p>

        groove for the adjustment of a wooden screen or shutter when it is
        desired to separate the house into two portions temporarily. At the
        end of the verandah to the left of the sketch is the latrine. The

        barred sliding door. A large hanging bay-window is also barred. Just
        over the fence a bamboo curtain may be seen, which shades the
        verandah. The back of the house was open, and probably looked out on
        a pretty garden,‚Äîthough this I did <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this example

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the northern
        part of Japan houses are often seen which possess features suggestive
        of the picturesque architecture of Switzerland,‚Äîthe gable ends
        showing, in their exterior, massive timbers roughly hewn, with all
        the irregularities of the tree-trunk preserved, the interstices
        between these beams being filled with clay or plaster. The eaves are
        widely overhanging, with projecting rafters. Oftentimes
        delicately-carved wood is seen about the gable-ends and projecting
        balcony. As a still further suggestion of this resemblance, the main
        roof, if shingled, as well as the roof that shelters the verandah, is
        weighted with stones of various sizes to prevent its being blown away
        by the high <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span> winds
        that often prevail. This feature is particularly common in the Island
        of Yezo.</p>

        Rikuzen. An opening for the egress of smoke occurs on the side of the
        roof, in shape not unlike that of a round-topped dormer window. This
        opening in almost every instance is found on the gable end, directly
        beneath the angle formed at the peak of the roof.</p>

        is heavily thatched, while the supplementary ridge is of boards and
        weighted with stones. A good example of a heavily-tiled and plastered

        luxuriant mass of lilies. This roof was unusually large and
        capacious.</p>

        the river Kitakami empties into the Bay of Sendai, and where we left
        our boat in which we had come down the river from Morioka, the houses

        projecting to support the eaves and the transverse-beams of the gable
        ends being equally in sight. The projecting window, which might
        perhaps be called a bay, runs nearly the entire length of the gable.
        The panels in the frieze were of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        pine and bamboo alternating.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The larger houses
        of this description are always inns. They usually abut directly upon
        the road, and have an open appearance and an air of hospitality about
        them which at once indicates their character. One encounters such
        places so frequently in Japan, that travelling in the interior is

        experiences in neighboring countries. The larger number of these inns
        in the north are of one-story, though many may be seen that are
        two-storied. Very rarely does a three-storied building occur.

        portions of the boundary wall. In the denser part of larger cities it
        is rare to find an old house,‚Äîthe devastating conflagrations that so
        often sweep across the cities rendering the survival of old houses
        almost an impossibility. In the suburbs of cities and in the country,
        however, it is not difficult to find houses one hundred, and even two
        or three hundred years old. The houses age as rapidly as the people,
        and new houses very soon turn gray from the weather; the poorer class
        of houses in particular appear much older than they really are.</p>

        standing with its end to the street,‚Äîthe peak of the thatched roof

        high, rustic, bamboo fence; and between the houses are little plats
        filled with bright-colored flowers, and shrubbery clustering within
        the fences, even sending its sprays into the footpath bordering the

        "font-style: italic">samurai,</span></em> or rich farmer, is large,
        roomy, and thoroughly comfortable. I recall with the keenest pleasure
        the delightful days enjoyed under the roof of one of these typical
        mansions in Kabutoyama, in the western part of the province of
        Musashi. The residence consisted of a group of buildings shut in from
        the road by a high wall. Passing through a ponderous gateway, one
        enters a spacious court-yard, flanked on either side by long, low
        buildings used as store-houses and servants' quarters. At the farther
        end of the yard, and facing the entrance, was a comfortable old
        farmhouse, having a projecting gable-wing to its right (<a href=
        "#myfig045" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        45</span></a>). The roof was a thatched one of unusual thickness. At
        the end of the wing was a triangular latticed opening, from which
        thin blue wreaths of smoke were curling. This building contained a
        few rooms, including an unusually spacious kitchen,‚Äîa sketch of which
        is given farther on. The kitchen opened directly into a larger and
        unfinished portion of the house, having the earth <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span> for its floor, and used as a
        wood-shed. The owner informed me that the farm-house was nearly three
        hundred years old. To the left of the building was a high wooden
        fence, and passing through a gateway one came into a smaller yard and
        garden. In this area was another house quite independent of the
        farmhouse; this was the house for guests. Its conspicuous feature
        consisted of a newly-thatched roof, surmounted by an elaborate and
        picturesque ridge,‚Äîits design derived from temple architecture.
        Within were two large rooms opening upon a narrow verandah. These
        rooms were unusually high in stud, and the mats and all the
        appointments were most scrupulously clean. Communication with the old
        house was by means of a covered passage. Back of this dwelling, and
        some distance from it, was still another house, two stories in
        height, and built in the most perfect taste; and here lived the
        grandfather of the family,‚Äîa fine old gentleman, dignified and
        courtly in his manners.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The farm-house
        yard presented all the features of similar areas at home. A huge pile
        of wood cut for the winter's supply was piled up against the L.
        Basket-like coops, rakes, and the customary utensils of a farmer's
        occupation were scattered about. The sketch of this old house gives
        but a faint idea of the massive and top-heavy appearance of the roof,
        or of the large size of the building. The barred windows below,
        covered by a narrow tiled roof, were much later additions to the
        structure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the city houses
        of the better class much care is often taken to make the surroundings
        appear as rural as possible, by putting here and there quaint old
        wells, primitive and rustic arbors, fences, and gateways. The
        gateways receive special attention in this way, and the oddest of
        entrances are often seen in thickly-settled parts of large
        cities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Houses with
        thatched roofs, belonging to the wealthiest classes, are frequently
        seen in the suburbs of Tokio and Kioto, and, strange as it may
        appear, even within the city proper. One might be led <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span> to suppose that such roofs
        would quickly fall a prey to the sparks of a conflagration; but an
        old thatched roof gets compacted with dust and soot to such an extent
        that plants and weeds of various kinds, and large clumps of mosses,
        are often seen flourishing in luxuriance upon such surfaces, offering
        a good protection against flying sparks. In Kioto we recall a house
        of this description which was nearly three centuries old; and since
        we made sketches of its appearance from the street, from just within
        the gateway, and from the rear, we will describe these views in
        sequence.</p>

        a heavily-roofed gateway, with a smaller gateway at the side. The big
        gates had been removed, and the little gateway was permanently
        closed. This ponderous structure was flanked on one side by a low
        stretch of buildings, plastered on the outside, having small barred
        windows on the street, and a barred look-out commanding the gateway
        both outside and within. On the other side of the gateway was a high,
        thick wall, also furnished with a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page65">[pg 65]</span> window or lookout. The outer walls rose
        directly from the wall forming the gutter, or, more properly
        speaking, a diminutive moat that ran along the side of the street.
        Blocks of worked stone formed a bridge across this moat, by which
        access was gained to the enclosure. The old dwelling, with its
        sharp-ridged roof, may be seen above the buildings just
        described.</p>

        steep pitch, surmounted by a ridge of tiles; a narrow tiled roof runs
        about the house directly below the eaves of the thatched roof.
        Suspended below this roof is seen a ladder and fire-engine, to be
        ready in case of emergency. The truth must be <span class=

        domestic engines are never ready; for when they are wanted, it is
        found that the square cylinders are so warped and cracked by the hot
        summers that when they are brought into action their chief
        accomplishment consists in squirting water through numerous crevices

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The yard was well
        swept, and quite free from weeds, though at one side a number of
        shrubs and a banana tree were growing in a luxuriant tangle. A single
        tree, of considerable age, rose directly in a line with the entrance
        to the yard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house, like
        all such houses, had its uninteresting end toward the street; and
        here, attached to the house, was a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúlean-to,‚Äù</span> or shed, with a small circular window.
        This was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span> probably
        a kitchen, as a gateway is seen in the sketch, which led to the
        kitchen-garden.</p>

        "#myfig048" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        48</span></a> a sketch of this house is given from the garden in the
        rear. The house is quite open behind, and looks out on the garden and
        fish-pond, which is seen in the foreground. The tiled roof which
        covers the verandah, and the out-buildings as well, was a subsequent
        addition to the old house. The sole occupants consisted of the mother
        and maiden sister of the famous antiquarian Ninagawa Noritani. The
        garden, with its shrubs, plats of flowers, stepping-stones leading to
        the fish-pond filled with lotus and lilies, and the bamboo trellis,
        is a good specimen of an old garden upon which but little care has
        been bestowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cities
        nothing is more surprising to a foreigner than to go from the dust
        and turmoil of a busy street directly into a rustic yard and the
        felicity of quiet country life. On one of the busy streets of Tokio I
        had often passed a low shop, the barred front of which was never
        opened to traffic, nor was there ever any one present with whom to
        deal. I used often to peer between the bars; and from the form of the
        wooden boxes on the step-like shelves within, I knew that the
        occupant was a dealer in old pottery. One day I called through the
        bars several times, and finally a man pushed back the screen in the
        rear of the shop and bade me come in by way of a narrow alley a
        little way up the street. This I did, and soon came to a gate that
        led me into one of the neatest and cleanest little gardens it is
        possible to imagine. The man was evidently just getting ready for a
        tea-party, and, as is customary in winter, the garden had been
        liberally strewn with pine-needles, which had then been neatly swept
        from the few paths and formed in thick mats around some of the shrubs
        and trees. The master had already accosted me from the verandah, and
        after bringing the customary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hibachi,</span></em> over which I warmed my
        hands, and tea and cake, he brought forth some rare old

        a narrow partition, made out of the planks of an old <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span> ship; it is secured to the
        side of the house by a huge piece of bamboo. One is greatly
        interested to see how curiously, and oftentimes artistically, the old
        worm-eaten and blackened fragments of a shipwreck are worked into the
        various parts of a house,‚Äîthis being an odd fancy of the Japanese
        house-builder. Huge and irregular-shaped logs will often form the
        cross-piece to a gateway; rudder-posts fixed in the ground form the
        support of bronze or pottery vessels to hold water. But fragments of
        a shipwreck are most commonly seen. This wood is always rich in
        color, and has an antique appearance,‚Äîthese qualities commending it
        at once to the Japanese eye, and rendering it, with its associations,
        an attractive object for their purposes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the house above
        mentioned a portion of a vessel's side or bottom had been used bodily
        for a screen at the end of the verandah,‚Äîfor just beyond was the
        latrine, from the side of which is seen jutting another wing,
        consisting of a single weatherworn plank bordered by a bamboo-post.
        This was a screen to shut out the kitchen-yard beyond. Various
        stepping-stones of irregular shape, as well as blackened planks, were
        arranged around the yard in picturesque disorder. The sketch conveys,
        with more or less accuracy, one of the many phases of Japanese taste
        in these matters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wood-work from
        the rafters of the verandah roof above, to the planks below, was
        undefiled by oil, paint, wood-filling, or varnish of any kind. The
        carpentry was light, yet durable and thoroughly constructive; while
        outside and inside every feature was as neat and clean as a cabinet.

        appearance of the balcony and verandah, and how well they are
        protected by the overhanging roofs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inns,
        particularly the country inns, have a most cosey and comfortable air
        about them. One always has the freedom of the entire place; at least
        a foreigner generally makes himself at home everywhere about the
        public houses, and in this respect <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page71">[pg 71]</span> impress a Japanese with his boorish ways,
        since the native guests usually keep to their own rooms. The big,
        capacious kitchen, with its smoke-blackened rafters overhead, its
        ruddy glow of wood-fire (a sight rarely seen in the cities, where
        charcoal is the principal fuel), and the family busy with their
        various domestic duties, is a most cosey and agreeable region.</p>

        Yezo, from Otarunai to Mororan, one passes a number of inns of the
        most ample proportions; and their present deserted appearance
        contrasts strangely with their former grandeur, when the Daimio of
        the province, accompanied by swarms of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">samurai</span></em>
        and other attendants, made his annual pilgrimage to the capital.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Mishima, in the
        province of Suruga, a curious old inn was seen (<a href="#myfig051"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 51</span></a>).
        The second story overhung the first story in front, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span> and the eaves were very
        widely-projecting. At the sides of the building a conspicuous feature
        was the verge boards, which were very large, with their lower margins
        cut in curious sweeps. This may have been intended for an
        architectural adornment, or possibly for a wind or sun screen; at all
        events it was, as we saw it, associated with buildings of
        considerable antiquity. In the middle and southern provinces of Japan
        the feature of an over-hanging second story is by no means
        uncommon.</p>

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span> antiquarian
        Ninagawa Noritani. In these buildings were stored his treasures of
        pottery and painting. Often light wooden extensions are built around
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> and in such cases the family
        live in the outside apartments. An example of this kind is shown in

        "color: blue">fig. 59</span></a>, which is an old house in a poor

        additional shelter having a tiled roof. In case of fire the contents
        of the outer rooms are hurriedly stowed within the fire-proof
        portion, the door closed, and the crevices chinked with mud. These
        buildings usually survive in the midst of a wide-spread
        conflagration, while all the outer wooden additions are consumed.
        Further reference will be made to these structures in other portions
        of the work. It may be proper to state, however, that nearly every
        shop has connected with it a fire-proof building of this nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It hardly comes
        within the province of this work to describe or figure buildings
        which are not strictly speaking homes; for this reason no reference
        will be made to the monotonous rows of buildings so common in Tokio,
        which form portions of the boundary-wall <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page77">[pg 77]</span> wall of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yashiki;</span></em>
        and, indeed, had this been desirable, it would have been somewhat
        difficult to find the material, in their original condition, for
        study. Many of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashikis</span></em> have been destroyed by
        fire; others have been greatly modified, and are now occupied by
        various Government departments. In Tokio, for example, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yashiki</span></em>
        of the Daimio of Kaga is used by the educational department, the Mito
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashiki</span></em> for the manufacture of war
        material, and still others are used for barracks and other Government
        purposes. As one rides through the city he often passes these
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashikis,</span></em> showing from the street as
        long monotonous rows of buildings, generally two stories in height,
        with heavy tiled roofs. The wall of the first story is generally
        tiled or plastered. The second-story wall may be of wood or plaster.
        This wall is perforated at intervals with small heavily-barred
        windows or hanging bays. The entrance, composed of stout beams, is
        closed by ponderous gates thickly studded with what appear to be
        massive-headed bolts, but which are, however, of fictitious solidity.
        The buildings rest on stone foundations abutting directly on the
        street, or interrupted by a ditch which often assumes the dignity of
        a castle moat. These buildings in long stretches formed a portion of
        the outer walls of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashikis</span></em> within which were the
        separate residences of the Daimios and officers, while the buildings
        just alluded to were used by the soldiers for barracks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
        elaboration and variety in the form and structure of the house-roof
        almost merit the dignity of a separate section. For it is mainly to
        the roof that the Japanese house owes its picturesque appearance; it
        is the roof which gives to the houses that novelty and variety which
        is so noticeable among them in different parts of the country. The
        lines of a well-made thatched roof are something quite remarkable in
        their proportions. A great deal of taste and skill is displayed in
        the proper trimming of the eaves; and the graceful way in which the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span> eaves of the
        gable are made to join the side eaves is always attractive and a
        noticeable feature in Japanese architecture, and the admirable way in
        which a variety of gables are made to unite with the main roof would
        excite praise from the most critical architect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The elaborate
        structure of the thatched and tiled roofs, and the great variety in
        the design and structure of the ridges show what might be done by a
        Japanese architect if other portions of the house-exterior received
        an equal amount of ingenuity and attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Japanese roofs are
        either shingled, thatched, or tiled. In the country, tiled roofs are
        the exception, the roofs being almost exclusively thatched,‚Äîthough in
        the smaller houses, especially in the larger country villages, the
        shingled and tiled roofs are often seen. In the larger towns and
        cities the houses are usually tiled; yet even here shingled roofs are
        not uncommon, and though cheaper than the tiled roofs, are by no
        means confined to the poorer houses. In the suburbs, and even in the
        outskirts of the cities, thatched roofs are common: in such cases the
        thatched roof indicates either the presence of what was at one time
        an old farm-house to which the city has extended, or else it is the
        house of a gentleman who prefers such a roof on account of its
        picturesqueness and the suggestions of rural life that go with
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usual form of
        the roof is generally that of a hip or gable. In the thatched roof,
        the portion coming directly below the ridge-pole is in the form of a
        gable, and this blends into a hip-roof. A curb-roof is never seen.
        Among the poorer classes a simple pent roof is common; and additions
        or attachments to the main building are generally covered with a pent
        roof. A light, narrow, supplementary roof is often seen projecting
        just below the eaves of the main roof; it is generally made of wide
        thin boards (<a href="#myfig060" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 60</span></a>). This roof is called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hisashi.</span></em>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span> It commonly
        shelters from the sun and rain an open portion of the house or a
        verandah. It is either supported by uprights from the ground, or by
        slender brackets which are framed at right angles to the main
        uprights of the building proper. Weak and even flimsy as this
        structure often appears to be, it manages to support itself, in
        violation of all known laws of structure and gravitation. After a
        heavy fall of damp snow one may see thick accumulations covering
        these slight roofs, and yet a ride through the city reveals no
        evidences of their breaking down. One recalls similar structures at
        home yielding under like pressure, and wonders whether gravitation
        behaves differently in this land of anomalies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ordinary
        shingled roof a light boarding is first nailed to the rafters, and
        upon this the shingles are secured in close courses. The shingles are
        always split, and are very thin,‚Äîbeing about the thickness of an
        ordinary octavo book-cover, and not much larger in size, and having
        the same thickness throughout. They come in square bunches (<a href=
        "#myfig061" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        61</span></a>, A), each bunch containing about two hundred and twenty
        shingles, and costing about forty cents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bamboo pins,
        resembling attenuated shoe-pegs, are used as shingle-nails. The
        shingler takes a mouthful of these pegs, and with quick motions works
        precisely and in the same rapid manner as a similar class of workmen
        do at home. The shingler's hammer is a curious implement (<a href=
        "#myfig061" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        61</span></a>, B, C). The iron portion is in the shape of a square
        block, with its roughened face nearly on a level with its handle.
        Near the end of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg
        80]</span> handle, and below, is inserted an indented strip of brass
        (<a href="#myfig061" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 61</span></a>, B). The shingler in grasping the
        handle brings the thumb and forfinger opposite the strip of brass; he
        takes a peg from his mouth with the same hand with which he holds the
        hammer, and with the thumb and forefinger holding the peg against the
        brass strip (<a href="#myfig062" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 62</span></a>), he forces it into the shingle by a
        pushing blow. By this movement the peg is forced half-way down; an
        oblique blow is then given it with the hammer-head, which bends the
        protruding portion of the peg against the shingle,‚Äîthis broken-down
        portion representing the head of our shingle-nail. The bamboo being
        tough and fibrous can easily be broken down without separating. In
        this way is the shingle held to the roof. The hammer-handle has
        marked upon it the smaller divisions <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page81">[pg 81]</span> of a carpenter's measure, so that the courses
        of shingles may be properly aligned. The work is done very
        rapidly,‚Äîfor with one hand the shingle is adjusted, while the other
        hand is busily driving the pegs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the shingles
        are not always held firmly to the roof by this method of shingling is
        seen in the fact that oftentimes long narrow strips of bamboo are
        nailed obliquely across the roof, from the ridge-pole to the eaves
        (<a href="#myfig063" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 63</span></a>). These strips are placed at the
        distance of eighteen inches or two feet apart. Yet even in spite of
        this added precaution, in violent gales the roof is often rapidly
        denuded of its shingles, which fill the air at such times like autumn
        leaves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a href=
        "#myfig064" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 64,
        A</span></a>, represents a portion of a shingled roof with courses of
        shingles partially laid, and a shingler's nail-box held to the roof.
        The box has two compartments,‚Äîthe larger compartment holding the
        bamboo pegs; and the smaller containing iron nails, used for nailing
        down the boards and for other purposes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are other
        methods of shingling, in which the courses of shingles are laid very
        closely together, and also in many layers. Remarkable examples of
        this method may be seen in some of the temple roofs, and particularly
        in the roofs of certain temple gateways in Kioto, where layers of the
        thinnest shingles, forming a mass a foot or more in thickness, are
        compactly laid, with the many graceful contours of the roof
        delicately preserved. The edges of the roof are beautifully rounded,
        and the eaves squarely and accurately trimmed. On seeing one of these
        roofs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span> one is
        reminded of a thatched roof, which this style seems evidently
        intended to imitate. The rich brown bark of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hi-no-ki</span></em>
        tree is also used in a similar way; and a very compact and durable
        roof it appears to make. In better shingled house-roofs it is
        customary to secure a wedge-shaped piece of wood parallel to the
        eaves, to which the first three or four rows of shingles are nailed;
        other courses of shingles are then laid on very closely, and thus a
        thicker layer of shingles is secured (<a href="#myfig064" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But little variety
        of treatment of the ridge is seen in a shingled roof. Two narrow
        weather-strips of wood nailed over the ridge answer the purpose of a
        joint, as is customary in our shingled roofs. A more thorough way is
        to nail thin strips of wood of a uniform length directly over the
        ridge and at right angles to it. These strips are thin enough to bend
        readily. Five or six layers are fastened in this way, and then, more
        firmly to secure them to the roof, two long narrow strips of wood or
        bamboo are nailed near the two edges of this mass, parallel to the
        ridge (<a href="#myfig065" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shingled roof
        is the most dangerous element of house-structure in the cities. The
        shingles are nothing more than thick shavings, and curved and warped
        by the sun are ready to spring into a blaze by the contact of the
        first spark that falls upon them, and then to be sent flying by a
        high wind to scatter the fire for miles. A very stringent law should
        be passed, prohibiting the use of such material for roofing in cities
        and large villages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usual form of
        gutter for conveying water from the roof consists of a large bamboo
        split lengthwise, with the natural partitions broken away. This is
        held to the eaves by iron hooks, or by long pieces of wood nailed to
        the rafters,‚Äîtheir upper edges being notched, in which the bamboo
        rests. This leads to a conductor, consisting also of a bamboo, in
        which the natural partitions have likewise been broken through. The
        upper end of this bamboo is cut away in such a manner as to leave
        four long spurs; between these spurs a square and tapering tunnel of
        thin wood is forced,‚Äîthe elasticity of the bamboo holding the tunnel
        in place (<a href="#myfig066" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 66</span></a>).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page84">[pg 84]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Attention has so
        often been drawn, in books of travels, to the infinite variety of
        ways in which Eastern nations use the bamboo, that any reference to
        the subject here would be superfluous. I can only say that the
        importance of this wonderful plant in their domestic economy has
        never been exaggerated. The more one studies the ethnographical
        peculiarities of the Japanese, as displayed in their houses,
        utensils, and countless other fabrications, the more fully is he
        persuaded that they could more easily surrender the many devices and
        appliances adopted from European nations, than to abandon the
        ubiquitous bamboo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In tiling a roof,
        the boarded roof is first roughly and thinly shingled, and upon this
        surface is then spread a thick layer of mud, into which the tiles are
        firmly bedded. The mud is scooped up from some ditch or moat, and is
        also got from the canals. In the city one often sees men getting the
        mud for this purpose from the deep gutters which border many of the
        streets. This is kneaded and worked with hoe and spade till it
        acquires the consistency of thick dough. In conveying this mass to
        the roof no hod is used. The material is worked into large lumps by
        the laborer, and these are tossed, one after another, to a man who
        stands on a staging or ladder, who in turn pitches it to the man on
        the roof, or, if the roof be high, to another man on a still higher
        staging. The mud having been got to the roof, is then spread over it
        in a thick and even layer. Into this the tiles are then bedded, row
        after row. There seems to be no special adhesion of the tiles to this
        substratum of mud, and high gales often cause great havoc to a roof
        of this nature. In the case of a conflagration, when it becomes
        necessary to tear down buildings in its path, the firemen appear to
        have no difficulty in shovelling the tiles off a roof with ease and
        rapidity.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ridge-pole
        often presents an imposing combination of tiles and plaster piled up
        in square ridges and in many ornamental ways. In a hip-roof the four
        ridges are also made thick and ponderous by successive layers of
        tiles being built up, and forming great square ribs. In large
        fire-proof buildings the ridge may be carried up to a height of three
        or four feet. In such ridges white plaster is freely used, not only
        as a cement, but as a medium in which the artist works out various
        designs in high-relief. One of the most favorite subjects selected is
        that of dashing and foaming waves. A great deal of art and skill is
        often displayed in the working out of this design,‚Äîwhich is generally
        very conventional, though at times great freedom of expression is
        shown in the work. It certainly seems an extraordinary design for the
        crest of a roof, though giving a very light and buoyant appearance to
        what would otherwise appear top-heavy. <a href="#myfig067" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 67</span></a> is a very
        poor sketch of the appearance of this kind of a ridge. From the
        common occurrence of this design, it would seem as if some sentiment
        or superstition led to using this watery subject as suggesting a
        protection from fire; whether this be so or not, one may often notice
        at the end of the ridge in the thatched roofs in the country
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span> the Chinese
        character for water deeply cut in the straw and blackened (<a href=
        "#myfig082" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        82</span></a>),‚Äîand this custom, I was told, originated in a
        superstition that the character for water afforded a protection
        against fire.</p>

        always terminate in a shouldered mass of tiles specially designed for
        the purpose. The smaller ribs of tiles that run down to the eaves,
        along the ridges in a hip-roof, or border the verge in a gable-roof,
        often terminate in some ornamental tile in high-relief. The design
        may be that of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span>
        mask, the head of a devil, or some such form. In the heavier ridges
        much ingenuity and art are shown in the arrangement of
        semi-cylindrical or other shaped tiles in conventional pattern. Figs.
        68, 69, 70 will illustrate some of the designs made in this way.
        These figures, however, represent copings of walls in Yamato.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
        heavier ridges are deceptive, the main body consisting of a frame of
        wood plastered over, and having the appearance externally of being a
        solid mass of tile and plaster The tiles that border the eaves are
        specially designed for the purpose. The tile has the form of the
        ordinary tile, but its free edge is turned down at right angles and
        ornamented with some conventional design. <a href="#myfig071" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 71</span></a>
        illustrates this form of tile. In the long panel a design of flowers
        or conventional scrolls in relief is often seen. The circular portion
        generally contains the crest of some family: the crest of the
        Tokugawa family is rarely seen on tiles (see <a href="#myfig073"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the better
        class of tiled roof it is common to point off with white mortar the
        joints between the rows of tiles near the eaves, and also next the
        ridge; and oftentimes the entire roof is treated in this manner. In
        some photographs of Korean houses taken by Percival Lowell, Esq., the
        same method of closing the seams of the bordering rows of tiles with
        white plaster is shown.</p>

        is, the better it is considered for roofing purposes. My attention
        was called to this fact by a friend stating to me with some pride
        that the tiles used in his house, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page88">[pg 88]</span> just constructed, were over forty years old.
        Second-hand tiles therefore are always in greater demand. A new tile,
        being very porous and absorbent, is not considered so good as one in
        which time has allowed the dust and dirt to fill the minute
        interstices, thus rendering it a better material for shedding
        water.</p>

        cannot be very expensive, as one finds it very common in the cities

        five <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        similar in form <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span>
        to those used in China, Korea, Singapore, and Europe. These tiles are
        slightly curved, and are laid with their convex surface downwards.
        Another form of tile, narrower and semi-cylindrical in section, is
        laid with its convex side upwards, covering the seams between the
        lower rows of tiles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A new form of
        tile, called the French tile, has been introduced into Tokio within a
        few years (<a href="#myfig075" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 75</span></a>). It is not in common use, however;
        and I can recall only a few buildings roofed with this tile. These
        are the warehouses of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg
        90]</span> Mitsu Bishi Steamship Company near the post-office, a
        building back of the Art Museum at Uyeno, and a few private
        houses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other forms of
        tiles are made for special purposes. In the province of Iwami, for
        example, a roof-shaped tile is made specially for covering the ridge
        of thatched roofs (<a href="#myfig076" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 76</span></a>, A). The
        true tile is also used for the same purpose (fig. 76, B).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this province
        the tiles are glazed,‚Äîthe common tiles being covered with a brown
        glaze, while the best tiles are glazed with iron sand. In digging the
        foundations for a library building at Uyeno Park, a number of large
        glazed tiles were dug up which were supposed to have been brought
        from the province of Bizen two hundred years ago. These were of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the province of
        Shimotsuke, and doubtless in adjacent provinces, stone <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kura</span></em>
        (fire-proof store-houses) are seen; and these buildings often have
        roofs of the same material. The stone appears to be a light-gray
        volcanic tufa, and is easily wrought. The slabs of stone covering the
        roof are wrought into definite shapes, so that the successive rows
        overlap and interlock in a way that gives the appearance of great
        solidity and strength. <a href="#myfig077" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 77</span></a>
        illustrates a portion of a roof of this description seen on the road
        to Nikko. I was told by a Korean friend that stone roofs were also to
        be found in the northern part of Korea, though whether made in this
        form could not be ascertained.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page91">[pg 91]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thatched roof
        is by far the most common form of roof in Japan, outside the cities.
        The slopes of the roof vary but little; but in the design and
        structure of the ridge the greatest variety of treatment is seen.
        South of Tokio each province seems to have its own peculiar style of
        ridge; at least, as the observant traveller passes from one province
        to another his attention is attracted by a new form of ridge, which
        though occasionally seen in other provinces appears to be
        characteristic of that particular province. This is probably due to
        the partially isolated life of the provinces in feudal times; for the
        same may be said also in regard to the pottery and many other
        products of the provinces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For thatching,
        various materials are employed. For the commonest thatching, straw is
        used; better kinds of thatch are made of a grass called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kaya.</span></em> A
        kind of reed called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi</span></em> is used for this purpose, and
        also certain species of rush. The roof requires no special
        preparation to receive the thatch, save that the rafters and
        frame-work shall be close enough together properly to secure and
        support it. If the roof be small, a bamboo frame-work is sufficient
        for the purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thatch is
        formed in suitable masses, combed with the fingers and otherwise
        arranged so that the straws all point in the same direction. These
        masses are then secured to the rafters and bound down to the roof by
        bamboo poles (<a href="#myfig078" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 78</span></a>, A), which are afterwards removed.
        While the thatch is bound down in this way it is beaten into place by
        a wooden mallet of peculiar shape (fig. 78, B). The thatch is then
        trimmed into shape by a pair of long-handled shears (fig. 78, C)
        similar to the shears used for trimming grass in our country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is only the
        barest outline of the process of thatching; there are doubtless many
        other processes which I did not see. Suffice it to say, however, that
        when a roof is finished it presents a clean, trim, and symmetrical
        appearance, which seems <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg
        92]</span> surprising when the nature of the material is considered.
        The eaves are trimmed off square or slightly rounding, and often very
        thick,‚Äîbeing sometimes two feet or more in thickness. This does not
        indicate, however, that the thatch is of the same thickness
        throughout. The thatch trimmed in these various ways is thus seen in
        section, and one will often notice in this section successive layers
        of light and dark thatch. Whether it is old thatch worked in with the
        new for the sake economy, or different kinds of thatching material, I
        did not ascertain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In old roofs the
        thatch becomes densely filled with soot and dust, and workmen engaged
        in repairing such roofs have the appearance of coal-heavers. While a
        good deal of skill and patience is required to thatch a roof evenly
        and properly, vastly more skill must be required to finish the ridge,
        which is often very intricate in its structure; and of these peculiar
        ridges there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span> are
        a number of prominent types. In presenting these types, more reliance
        will be placed on the sketches to convey a general idea of their
        appearance than on descriptions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In that portion of
        Japan lying north of Tokio the ridge is much more simple in its
        construction than are those found in the southern part of the Empire.
        The roofs are larger, but their ridges, with some exceptions, do not
        show the artistic features, or that variety in form and appearance,
        that one sees in the ridges of the southern thatched roof. In many
        cases the ridge is flat, and this area is made to support a luxuriant
        growth of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">iris,</span></em> or the red lily (<a href=
        "#myfig041" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        41</span></a>). A most striking feature is often seen in the
        appearance of a brown sombre-colored village, wherein all the ridges
        are aflame with the bright-red blossoms of the lily; or farther
        south, near Tokio, where the purer colors of the blue and white iris
        form floral crests of exceeding beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some cases
        veritable ridge-poles, with their ends freely projecting beyond the
        gable and wrought in a gentle upward curve, are seen (<a href=
        "#myfig039" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        39</span></a>). This treatment of the free ends of beams in

        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> is a
        common feature in Japanese architecture, and is effective in giving a
        light and buoyant appearance to what might otherwise appear heavy and
        commonplace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Fujita, in
        Iwaki, and other places in that region, a roof is often seen which
        shows the end of a round ridge-pole <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page94">[pg 94]</span> projecting through the thatch at the
        gable-peak; and at this point a flat spur of wood springs up from the
        ridge, to which is attached, at right angles, a structure made of
        plank and painted black, which projects two feet or more beyond the
        gable. This appears to be a survival of an exterior ridge-pole, and
        is retained from custom. Its appearance, however, is decidedly flimsy
        and insecure, and from its weak mode of attachment it must be at the
        mercy of every high gale (<a href="#myfig079" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 79</span></a>). After
        getting south of Sendai, ridges composed of tile are often to be
        seen,‚Äîbecoming more common as one approaches Tokio. The construction
        of this kind of ridge is very simple and effective; semi-cylindrical
        tiles, or the wider forms of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hon-gawara,</span></em> are used for the crest,
        and these in turn cap a row of similar tiles placed on either side of
        the ridge (fig. 80). The tiles appear to be bedded in a layer of clay
        or mud and chopped straw, which is first piled on to the thatched
        ridge. In some cases a large bamboo holds the lower row of tiles in
        place (<a href="#myfig081" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 81</span></a>). What other means there are of
        holding the tiles I did not learn. They must be fairly secure,
        however, as it is rare to see them displaced, even in old roofs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very neat and
        durable ridge (<a href="#myfig082" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 82</span></a>) is common in Musashi and
        neighboring provinces. This ridge is widely rounded. It <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span> is first covered with a layer
        of small bamboos; then narrow bands of bamboo or bark are bent over
        the ridge at short intervals, and these are kept in place by long
        bamboo-strips or entire bamboos, which run at intervals parallel to
        the ridge. These are firmly bound down to the thatch. In some cases
        these outer bamboos form a continuous layer. The ends of the ridge,
        showing a mass of projecting thatch in section, are abruptly cut
        vertically, and the free border is rounded in a bead-like moulding
        and closely bound by bamboo, appearing like the edge of a thick
        basket. This finish is done in the most thorough and workman-like
        manner. It is upon the truncate end of this kind of a ridge that the
        Chinese character for water is often seen, allusion to which has
        already been made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When there is no
        window at the end of the roof for the egress of smoke, the roof comes
        under the class of hip-roofs. In the northern provinces the opening
        for the smoke is built in various ways upon the ridge or side of the
        roof. By referring to figs. 39, 40, 41, various methods of providing
        for this window may be seen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Smoke-outlets do
        occur at the ends of the roof in the north, as may be seen by
        referring to <a href="#myfig044" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 44</span></a>. The triangular opening for the
        outlet of smoke is a characteristic feature of the thatched
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span> roofs south of
        Tokio; on some of them a great deal of study and skill is bestowed by
        the architect and builder. Sometimes an additional gable is seen,
        with its triangular window (<a href="#myfig083" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 83</span></a>). This
        sketch represents the roof of a gentleman's house near Tokio, and is
        a most beautiful example of the best form of thatched roof in
        Musashi. Another grand old roof of a different type is shown in fig.
        84. Where these triangular windows occur the opening is protected by
        a lattice of wood. The roof partakes of the double nature of a gable
        and hip roof combined,‚Äîthe window <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page97">[pg 97]</span> being in the gable part, from the base of
        which runs the slope of the hip-roof.</p>

        given to the proper and symmetrical trimming of the thatch at the
        eaves and at the edges of the gable. By referring to figs. 83 and 84
        some idea may be got of the clever way in which this is managed.
        Oftentimes, at the peak of the gable, a cone-like enlargement with a
        circular depression is curiously shaped out of the thatch (<a href=
        "#myfig084" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        84</span></a>). A good deal of skill is also shown in bringing the
        thick edges of the eaves, which are on different levels, together in
        graceful curves. An example of this kind may be seen in <a href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Musashi a not
        uncommon form of ridge is seen, in which there is an external
        ridge-pole wrought like the upper transverse beam of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tori-i.</span></em>
        This beam has a vertical thickness of twice or three times its width;
        resting transversely upon it, and at short intervals, are a number of
        wooden structures shaped like the letter X,‚Äîthe lower ends of these
        pieces resting on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
        98]</span> slopes of the roof, the upper ends projecting above the
        ridgepole. The ridge at this point is matted with bark; and running
        parallel with the ridge a few bamboos are fastened, upon which these
        cross-beams rest, and to which they are secured (<a href="#myfig045"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        45</span></a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modifications of
        this form of ridge occur in a number of southern provinces, and
        ridges very similar to this I saw in Saigon and Cholon, in Anam. The
        curious Shin-t≈ç temple, at Kamijiyama, in Ise, said to be modelled
        after very ancient types of roof, has the end-rafters of the gable
        continuing through the roof and beyond the peak to a considerable
        distance. It was interesting to see precisely the same features in
        some of the Malay houses in the neighborhood of Singapore. In
        Musashi, and farther south, a ridge is seen of very complex
        structure,‚Äîthe entire ridge forming a kind of supplementary roof, its
        edges thick and squarely trimmed, and presenting the appearance of a
        smaller roof having been made independently and dropped upon the
        large roof like a saddle. This style of roof, with many
        modifications, is very common in Yamashiro, Mikawa, and neighboring
        provinces. A very elaborate roof of this description is shown in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span> <a href=
        "#myfig085" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        85</span></a>. This roof was sketched in Kabutoyama, a village nearly
        fifty miles west of Tokio. In this ridge the appearance of a
        supplementary roof is rendered more apparent by the projection
        beneath of what appears to be a ridge-pole, and also parallel sticks
        of the roof proper. This roof had a remarkably picturesque and
        substantial appearance. This style of roof is derived from temple
        architecture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very simple form
        of ridge is common in the province of Omi; this is made of thin
        pieces of board, three feet or more in length, secured on each slope
        of the roof and at right angles to the ridge; and these are bound
        down by long strips of wood, two resting across the ridge, and
        another strip resting on the lower edge of the boards (<a href=
        "#myfig086" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        86</span></a>). In the provinces of Omi and Owari tiled ridges are
        often seen, and some ridges in which wood and tile are combined. At
        Takatsuki-mura, in Setsu, a curious ridge prevails. The ridge is very
        steep, and is covered by a close mat of bamboo, with saddles of tiles
        placed at intervals along the ridge (fig. 87). A very picturesque
        form of ridge occurs in the province of Mikawa; the roof is a
        hip-roof, with the ridge-roof having a steep slope trimmed off
        squarely at the eaves. On this portion strips of brown bark are
        placed across the ridge, resting on the slopes of the roof; a number
        of bamboos rest on the bark, parallel to the ridge; on the top of
        these, stout, semi-cylindrical saddles, sometimes sheathed with bark,
        rest across the ridge, with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
        100]</span> an interspace of three or four feet between them.
        <a href="#myfig088" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 88</span></a> represents a roof with three of
        these saddles, which is the usual number. These saddles are firmly
        bound to the roof, and on their crests and directly over the ridge a
        long bamboo is secured by a black-fibred cord, which is tied to the
        ridge between each saddle. The smoke-outlet at the end of the
        ridge-gable is protected by a mass of straw hanging down from the
        apex of the window, in shape and appearance very much like a Japanese
        straw rain-coat. The smoke filters out through this curtain, though
        the rain cannot beat in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Roofs of a
        somewhat similar construction may be seen in other provinces. In the
        suburbs of Kioto a form of roof and ridge, after a similar design,
        may be often seen. In this form the supplementary roof is more
        sharply defined; the corners of it are slightly turned up as in the
        temple-roof. To be more definite, the main roof, which is a hip-roof,
        has built upon it a low upper-roof, which is a gable; and upon this
        rests, like a separate structure, a continuous saddle of thatch,
        having upon its back a few bamboos running longitudinally,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span> and across the
        whole a number of thick narrow saddles of thatch sheathed with bark,
        and over all a long bamboo bound to the ridge with cords (<a href=
        "#myfig089" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.

        deep-set, heavily latticed smoke-windows, and the warm brown thatch,
        form a pleasing contrast to the thin-shingled roofs of the poorer
        neighboring houses.</p>

        being bound down by parallel strips, or whole rods of bamboo; and

        is a small triangular opening (<a href="#myfig091" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 91</span></a>). In the
        province of Yamato there are two forms of roof very common. In one of
        these the roof is a gable, the end-walls, plastered with clay and
        chopped straw, projecting above the roof a foot or more, and capped
        with a simple row of tiles (<a href="#myfig092" class=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span> slopes of the
        roof is trimmed in such a way as to present the appearance of a
        series of thick layers, resting one upon another like shingles, only
        each lap being eighteen inches to two feet apart, with thick edges.
        It was interesting and curious to find in the ancient province of
        Yamato this peculiar treatment of the slopes of a thatched roof,

        of Totomi and Suruga a form of ridge was observed, unlike any
        encountered elsewhere in Japan. The ridge-roof was large and sharply
        angular. Resting upon the thatch, from the ridge-pole half way down
        to the main roof, were bamboos placed side by side, parallel to the
        ridge. Upon this layer of bamboos were wide saddles of bark a foot or
        more in length, with an interspace of nearly two feet between each
        saddle, these reaching down to the main roof. On each side of the
        ridge-roof, and running parallel to the ridge, were large bamboo
        poles resting on the saddles, and bound down firmly with cords. On
        the sharp crest of the roof rested a long round ridge-pole. This pole
        was kept in place by wide <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
        104]</span> bamboo slats, bent abruptly into a yoke, in shape not
        unlike a pair of sugar-tongs, and these spanning the pole were thrust
        obliquely into the thatch. These were placed in pairs and crosswise
        in the interspaces between the bark saddles. On the ends of the ridge
        there were two bamboo yokes together. The sketch of this roof
        (<a href="#myfig093" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        Ise a simple type of roof was seen (<a href="#myfig094" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 94</span></a>). The
        ridge-roof was quite low, sheathed with bark and bound down with a
        number of bamboos. At the gable were round masses of thatch covered
        with bark, which formed an ornamental moulding at the verge.<a id=

        Osumi, on the eastern side of Kagoshima Gulf, the vertical walls of
        the buildings are very low; but these support thatched roofs of
        ponderous proportions. These roofs <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span> are somewhat steeper than the northern
        roof, and their ridges are wide and bluntly rounded. The ends of the
        ridge are finished with a wide matting of bamboo, and this material
        is used in binding down the ridge itself (<a href="#myfig054" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 54</span></a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
        doubtless many other forms of thatched roof, but it is believed that
        the examples given present the leading types.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As one becomes
        familiar with the picturesqueness and diversity in the Japanese roof
        and ridge, he wonders why the architects of our own country have not
        seen fit to extend their taste and ingenuity to the roof, as well as
        to the sides of the house. There is no reason why the ridge of an
        ordinary wooden house should invariably be composed of two narrow
        weather-strips, or why the roof itself should always be stiff,
        straight, and angular. Certainly our rigorous climate can be no
        excuse for this, for on the upper St. John, and in the northern part
        of Maine, one sees the wooden houses of the French Canadians having
        roofs widely projecting, with the eaves gracefully turning upward,
        presenting a much prettier appearance than does the stiff angular
        roof of the New England house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is indeed a
        matter of wonder that some one in building a house in this country
        does not revert to a thatched roof. Our architectural history shows
        an infinite number of reversions, and if a thatched roof were again
        brought into vogue, a new charm would be added to our landscape. The
        thatched roof is picturesque and warm, and makes a good rain-shed. In
        Japan an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
        ordinary thatched roof will remain in good condition from fifteen to
        twenty years; and I have been told that the best kinds of thatched
        roof will endure for fifty years, though this seems incredible. As
        they get weather-worn they are often patched and repaired, and
        finally have to be entirely renewed. Old roofs become filled with
        dust, assume a dark color, and get matted down; plants, weeds, and
        mosses of various kinds grow upon them, as well as masses of gray
        lichen. When properly constructed they shed water very promptly, and
        do not get water-soaked, as one might suppose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is customary in
        the better class of houses having thatched roofs to pave the ground
        with small cobble-stones, for a breadth of two feet or more
        immediately below the eaves, to catch the drip, as in a thatched roof
        it is difficult to adjust any sort of a gutter or water-conductor.
        Fig. 95 illustrates the appearance of the paved space about a house,
        the roof of which is shown in <a href="#myfig085" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The translation of
        the terms applied to many parts of the house is quite curious and
        interesting. The word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mune,</span></em> signifying the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span> ridge of the house, has the
        same meaning as with us; the same word is applied to the back of a
        sword and to the ridge of a mountain. In Korea the ridge of the
        thatched roof is braided, or at least the thatch seems to be knotted
        or braided at this point; and the Korean word for the ridge means
        literally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">back-bone,</span></em> from its resemblance to
        the back-bone of a fish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Japan the roof
        of a house is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yane.</span></em> Now, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yane</span></em>
        literally means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">house-root;</span></em> but how such a term
        could be applied to the roof is a mystery. I have questioned many
        intelligent Japanese in regard to this word, and have never received
        any satisfactory answer as to the reason of its application to the
        roof of a house. A Korean friend has suggested that the name might
        have been applied through association: a tree without a root dies,
        and a house without a roof decays. He also told me that the Chinese
        character <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ne</span></em> meant origin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Korea the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The interior of a
        Japanese house is so simple in its construction, and so unlike
        anything to which we are accustomed in the arrangement of details of
        interiors in this country, that it is difficult to find terms of
        comparison in attempting to describe it. Indeed, without the
        assistance of sketches it would be almost impossible to give a clear
        idea of the general appearance, and more especially the details, of
        Japanese house-interiors. We shall therefore mainly rely on the
        various figures, with such aid as description may render.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first thing
        that impresses one on entering a Japanese house is the small size and
        low stud of the rooms. The ceilings are so low that in many cases one
        can easily touch them, and in going from one room to another one is
        apt to strike his head against the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kamoi,</span></em> or
        lintel. He notices also the constructive features everywhere
        apparent,‚Äîin the stout wooden posts, supports, cross-ties, etc. The
        rectangular shape of the rooms, and the general absence of all jogs
        and recesses save the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> and companion recess in the
        best room are noticeable features. These recesses vary in depth from
        two to three feet or more, depending on the size of the room, and are
        almost invariably in that side of the room which runs at a right
        angle with the verandah (<a href="#myfig096" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 96</span></a>); or if in
        the second story, at a right <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page109">[pg 109]</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg
        110]</span> angle with the balcony. The division between the recesses
        consists of a light partition, partly or wholly closed, which
        generally separates the recesses into two equal bays. The bay nearest
        the verandah is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma.</span></em> In this recess hang one or
        two pictures, usually one; and on its floor, which is slightly raised
        above the level of the mats of the main floor, stands a vase or some
        other ornament. The companion bay has usually a little closet or
        cupboard closed by sliding screens, and one or two shelves above, and
        also another long shelf near its ceiling, all closed by sliding
        screens. At the risk of some repetition, more special reference will
        be made farther on to these peculiar and eminently characteristic
        features of the Japanese house.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my remarks on
        Japanese house-construction, in Chapter I., allusion was made to the
        movable partitions dividing the rooms, consisting of light frames of
        wood covered with paper. These are nearly six feet in height, and
        about three feet in width. The frame-work of a house, as we have
        already said, is arranged with special reference to the sliding
        screens, as well as to the number of mats which are to cover the
        floor. In each corner of the room is a square post, and within
        eighteen inches or two feet of the ceiling cross-beams ran from post
        to post. These cross-beams have grooves on their under side in which
        the screens are to run. Not only are most of the partitions between
        the rooms made up of sliding screens, but a large portion of the
        exterior partitions as well are composed of these light and
        adjustable devices. A house may have a suite of three or four rooms
        in a line, and the outside partitions be made up entirely of these
        movable screens and the necessary posts to support the roof,‚Äîthese
        posts coming in the corners of the rooms and marking the divisions
        between the rooms. The outer screens are covered with white paper,
        and when closed, a subdued and diffused light enters the room. They
        may be quickly removed, leaving the entire front of the house open to
        the air and sunshine. The screens between <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page111">[pg 111]</span> the rooms are covered with a thick
        paper, which may be left plain, or ornamented with sketchy or
        elaborate drawings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The almost entire
        absence of swinging doors is at once noticeable, though now and then
        one sees them in other portions of the house. The absence of all
        paint, varnish, oil, or filling, which, too often defaces our rooms
        at home, is at once remarked; and the ridiculous absurdity of
        covering a good grained wood-surface with paint, and then with brush
        and comb trying to imitate Nature by scratching in a series of lines,
        the Japanese are never guilty of. On the contrary, the wood is left
        in just the condition in which it leaves the cabinet-maker's plane,
        with a simple surface, smooth but not polished,‚Äîthough polished
        surfaces occur, however, which will be referred to in the proper
        place. Oftentimes in some of the parts the original surface of the
        wood is left, sometimes with the bark retained. Whenever the Japanese
        workman can leave a bit of Nature in this way he is delighted to do
        so. He is sure to avail himself of all curious features in wood: it
        may be the effect of some fungoid growth which marks a bamboo
        curiously; or the sinuous tracks produced by the larvae of some
        beetle that oftentimes traces the surface of wood, just below the
        bark, with curious designs; or a knot or burl. His eye never misses
        these features in finishing a room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The floors are
        often roughly made, for the reason that straw mats, two or three
        inches in thickness, cover them completely. In our remarks on
        house-construction, allusion has already been made to the dimensions
        of these mats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before proceeding
        further into the details of the rooms, it will be well to examine the
        plans of a few dwellings copied directly from the architect's
        drawings. The first plan given (<a href="#myfig097" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 97</span></a>) is that
        of a house built in Tokio a few years ago, in which the writer has
        spent many pleasant hours. The main house measures <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span> twenty-one by thirty-one
        feet; the L measures fifteen by twenty-four feet. The solid black
        squares represent the heavier upright beams which support the roof.
        The solid black circles represent the support for the L as well as
        for the verandah roof. The areas marked with close parallel lines
        indicate the verandah, while the double parallel lines indicate the
        sliding screens,‚Äîthe solid black lines showing the permanent
        partitions. The kitchen, bathroom, and certain platforms are
        indicated by parallel lines somewhat wider apart than those that
        indicate the verandah. The lines running obliquely indicate an area
        where the boards run towards a central gutter slightly depressed
        below the common level of the floor. Here stands the large earthen
        water-jar or the wooden bath-tub; and water spilled upon the floor
        finds its way out of the house by the gutter. The small areas on the
        outside of the house, shaded in section, represent the closets or
        cases in which the storm-blinds or wooden shutters, which so
        effectually close the house at night, are stowed away in the
        day-time. The house contains a vestibule, a hall, seven rooms, not
        including the kitchen, and nine closets. These rooms, if named after
        our nomenclature, would be as follows: study, library, parlor,
        sitting-room, dining-room, bed-room, servants'-room, and kitchen. As
        no room contains any article of furniture like a bedstead.‚Äîthe bed
        consisting of wadded comforters, being made up temporarily upon the
        soft mats,‚Äîit is obvious that the bedding can be placed in any room
        in the house. The absence of nearly all furniture gives one an
        uninterrupted sweep of the floor, so that the entire floor can be
        covered with sleepers if necessary,‚Äîa great convenience certainly
        when one has to entertain unexpectedly a crowd of guests over-night.
        Certain closets are used as receptacles for the comforters, where
        they are stowed away during the day-time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The absence of all
        barns, wood-sheds, and other out-houses is particularly noticeable,
        and as the house has no cellar, one wonders where the fuel is stowed.
        In certain areas of the kitchen <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page114">[pg 114]</span> floor the planks are removable, the edges
        of special planks being notched to admit the finger, so that they can
        be lifted up one by one; and beneath them a large space is revealed,
        in which wood and charcoal are kept. In the vestibule, which has an
        earth floor, is a narrow area of wood flush with the floor within,
        and in this also the boards may be lifted up in a similar way,
        disclosing a space below, wherein the wooden clogs and umbrellas may
        be stowed out of sight. These arrangements in the hall are seen in
        the houses of the moderately well-to-do people, but not, so far as I
        know, in the houses of the wealthy.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this house the
        dining-room and library are six-mat rooms, the parlor is an eight-mat
        room, and the sitting-room a four and one-half mat room; that is, the
        floor of each room accommodates the number of mats mentioned. The
        last three named rooms are bordered by the verandah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The expense of
        this house complete was about one thousand dollars. The land upon
        which it stood contained about 10,800 square feet, and was valued at
        three hundred and thirty dollars. Upon this the Government demanded a
        tax of five dollars. The house furnished with these mats, requires
        little else with which to begin house-keeping.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A comfortable
        house, fit for the habitation of a family of four or five, may be
        built for a far less sum of money, and the fewness and cheapness of
        the articles necessary to furnish it surpass belief. In mentioning
        such a modest house and furnishing, the reader must not imagine that
        the family are constrained for want of room, or stinted in the
        necessary furniture; on the contrary, they are enabled to live in the
        most comfortable manner. Their wants are few, and their tastes are
        simple and refined. They live without the slightest ostentation; no
        false display leads them into criminal debt. The monstrous bills for
        carpets, curtains, furniture, silver, dishes, etc., often entailed
        upon young house-keepers at home in any attempt at <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span> house-keeping,‚Äîthe
        premonition even of such bills often preventing marriage,‚Äîare social
        miseries that the Japanese happily know but little about.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simple as the
        house just given appears to be, there is quite as much variety in the
        arrangement of their rooms as with us. There are cheap types of
        houses in Japan, as in our country, where room follows room in a
        certain sequence; but the slightest attention to these matters will
        not only show great variety in their plans, but equally great variety
        in the ornamental finishing of their apartments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plan shown in
        <a href="#myfig098" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 98</span></a> is that of the house represented in
        figs. 36 and 37. The details are figured as in the previous plan.
        This house has on the ground-floor seven rooms besides the kitchen,
        hall, and bath-room. The kitchen and bath-room are indicated, as in
        the former plan, by their floors being ruled in wide parallel
        lines,‚Äîthe lines running obliquely, as in the former case, indicating
        the bath-room or wash-rooms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The owner of this
        house has often welcomed me to its soft mats and quiet atmosphere,
        and in the enjoyment of them I have often wondered as to the
        impressions one would get if he could be suddenly transferred from
        his own home to this unpretentious house, with its quaint and
        pleasant surroundings. The general nakedness, or rather emptiness, of
        the apartments would be the first thing noticed; then gradually the
        perfect harmony of the tinted walls with the wood finish would be
        observed. The orderly adjusted screens, with their curious free-hand
        ink-drawings, or conventional designs on the paper of so subdued and
        intangible a character that special attention must be directed to
        them to perceive their nature; the clean and comfortable mats
        everywhere smoothly covering the floor; the natural woods composing
        the ceiling and the structural finishing of the room everywhere
        apparent; the customary recesses with their cupboard and shelves, and
        the room-wide lintel with its elaborate lattice or carving
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span> above,‚Äîall
        these would leave lasting impressions of the exquisite taste and true
        refinement of the Japanese.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I noticed that a
        peculiarly agreeable odor of the wood used in the structure of this
        house seemed to fill the air of the rooms with a a delicate
        perfume;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span> in this
        connection I was led to think of the rooms I had seen in America
        encumbered with chairs, bureaus, tables, bedsteads, wash-stands,
        etc., and of the dusty carpets and suffocating wall-paper, hot with
        some frantic design, and perforated with a pair of quadrangular
        openings, wholly or partially closed against light and air. Recalling
        this labyrinth of varnished furniture, I could but remember how much
        work is entailed upon some one properly to attend to such a room; and
        enjoying by contrast the fresh air and broad flood of light, limited
        only by the dimensions of the room, which this Japanese house
        afforded, I could not recall with any pleasure the stifling
        apartments with which I had been familiar at home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If a foreigner is
        not satisfied with the severe simplicity, and what might at first
        strike him as a meagreness, in the appointments of a Japanese house,
        and is nevertheless a man of taste, he is compelled to admit that its
        paucity of furniture and carpets spares one the misery of certain
        painful feelings that incongruities always produce. He recalls with
        satisfaction certain works on household art, in which it is
        maintained that a table with carved cherubs beneath, against whose
        absurd contours one knocks his legs, is an abomination; and that
        carpets which have depicted upon them winged angels, lions, or
        tigers,‚Äîor, worse still, a simpering and reddened maiden being made
        love to by an equally ruddy shepherd,‚Äîare hardly the proper surfaces
        to tread upon with comfort, though one may take a certain grim
        delight in wiping his soiled boots upon them. In the Japanese house
        the traveller is at least not exasperated with such a medley of
        dreadful things; he is certainly spared the pains that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúcivilized‚Äù</span> styles of appointing and furnishing
        often produce. Mr. Lowell truthfully remarks on <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúthe waste, and aimlessness of our American luxury, which
        is an abject enslavement to tawdry upholstery.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are digressing,
        however. In the plan referred to, an idea of the size of the rooms
        may be formed by observing the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span> number of mats in each room, and recalling
        the size of the mats, which is about three feet by six. It will be
        seen that the rooms are small, much smaller than those of a similar
        class of American houses, though appearing more roomy from the
        absence of furniture. The three rooms bordering the verandah and
        facing the garden are readily thrown into one, and thus a continuous
        apartment is secured, measuring thirty-six feet in length by twelve
        in width; and this is uninterrupted, with the exception of one small
        partition.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
        "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the manner of
        building, one recognizes the propriety of constructive art as being
        in better taste; and in a Japanese house one sees this principle
        carried out to perfection. The ceiling of boards, the corner posts
        and middle posts and transverse ties are in plain sight. The corner
        posts which support the roof play their part as a decorative feature,
        as they pass stoutly upward from the ground beneath. A fringe of
        rafters rib the lower surface of the wide overhanging eaves, and
        these in turn rest firmly on an unhewn beam which runs as a girder
        from one side of the verandah to the other. The house is simply
        charming in all its appointments, and as a summer-house during the
        many long hot months it is incomparable. In the raw and rainy days of
        winter, however, it is not so pleasant, at least to a
        foreigner,‚Äîthough I question whether to a Japanese it is more
        unpleasant than the ordinary houses at home are with us, with some of
        the apartments hot and stifling, and things cracking with the furnace
        heat, while other parts are splitting with the cold; with gas from
        the furnace, and chimneys that often refuse to draw, and an
        impalpable though tangible soot and coal-dust settling on every
        object, and many other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span> abominations that are too well known. The Japanese do not
        suffer from the cold as we do. Moreover, when in the house they
        clothe themselves much more warmly; and for what little artificial
        warmth they desire, small receptacles containing charcoal are
        provided, over which they warm themselves, at the same time keeping
        their feet warm, as a hen does her eggs, by sitting on them. Their
        indifference to cold is seen in the fact that in their winter-parties
        the rooms will often be entirely open to the garden, which may be
        glistening with a fresh snowfall. Their winters are of course much
        milder than our Northern winters. At such seasons, however, an
        American misses in Japan the cheerful open fireplace around which the
        family in his own country is wont to gather; indeed, with the social
        character of our family life a Japanese house to us would be in
        winter comfortless to the last degree.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The differences
        between the houses of the nobles and the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">samurai</span></em>
        are quite as great as the differences between these latter houses and
        the rude shelters of the peasant class. The differences between the
        interior finish of the houses of the first two mentioned classes are
        perhaps not so marked, as in both cases clean wood-work, simplicity
        of style, and purity of finish are aimed at; but the house of the
        noble is marked by a grander entrance, a far greater extent of rooms
        and passages, and a modification in the arrangement of certain rooms
        and passages not seen in the ordinary house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The punctilious
        way in which guests or official callers were received by the Daimio
        is indicated by a curious modification <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page120">[pg 120]</span> of the floor of one of a suite of rooms,
        which is raised a few inches above the level of the other floors,
        forming a sort of dais. These rooms are bordered by a sort of
        passage-way, or intermediate portion, called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iri-kawa,</span></em>
        which comes between the room and the verandah. To be more explicit:
        within the boundary of the principal guest-room there appears to be a
        suite of smaller rooms marked off by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji;</span></em>
        one of these rooms called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ge-dan</span></em> has its floor on a level with
        the other floors of the house. The other room, called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">j≈ç-dan,</span></em>
        has its floor raised to a height of three or four inches above that
        of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ge-dan,</span></em> its boundary or border being
        marked by a polished plank forming a frame, so to speak, for the

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ge-dan</span></em>
        are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana.</span></em> On entering such a room
        from the verandah one passes through the usual <em class=

        and then across a matted area called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">iri-kawa,</span></em>
        the width of one mat or more; here he comes to another line of
        sliding screens, which open into the apartments just described. When
        the Daimio receives the calls from those who come to congratulate him
        on New Year's day, and other important occasions, he sits in great
        dignity in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        attendants occupy the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ge-dan,</span></em> and there make their
        obeisance to the Worshipful Daimio Sama. In the same plan there is
        another suite of rooms called the <em class=

        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        probably used for similar purposes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this plan the

        more,‚Äîthe upper surface being covered with a straw-matting precisely
        like the Canton matting we are familiar with, though in the better
        class of mats of a little finer quality. The edges are trimmed true
        and square, and the two longer sides are bordered on the upper
        surface and edge with a strip of black linen an inch or more in width
        (<a href="#myfig100" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The making of mats
        is quite a separate trade from that of making the straw-matting with
        which they are covered. The mat-maker may often be seen at work in
        front of his door, crouching down to a low frame upon which the mat
        rests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we have before
        remarked, the architect invariably plans his rooms to accommodate a
        certain number of mats; and since these mats have a definite size,
        any indication on the plan of the number of mats a room is to contain
        gives at once its dimensions also. The mats are laid in the following
        numbers,‚Äîtwo, three, four and one-half, six, eight, ten, twelve,
        fourteen, sixteen, and so on. In the two-mat room the mats are laid
        side by side. In the three-mat room the mats may be laid side by
        side, or two mats in one way and the third mat crosswise at the end.
        In the four and one-half mat room the mats are laid with the half-mat
        in one corner. The six and eight mat rooms are the most common-sized
        rooms; and this gives some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
        123]</span> indication of the small size of the ordinary Japanese
        room and house,‚Äîthe six-mat room being about nine feet by twelve; the
        eight-mat room being twelve by twelve; and the ten-mat room being
        twelve by fifteen. The accompanying sketch (<a href="#myfig101"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 101</span></a>)
        shows the usual arrangements for these mats.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In adjusting mats
        to the floor, the corners of four mats are never allowed to come
        together, but are arranged so that the corners of two mats abut
        against the side of a third. They are supposed to be arranged in the
        direction of a closely-wound spiral (see dotted line in <a href=
        "#myfig101" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        101</span></a>). The edges of the longer sides of the ordinary mats
        are bound with a narrow strip of black linen, as before remarked. In
        the houses of the nobles this border strip has figures worked into it
        in black and white, as may be seen by reference to Japanese
        illustrated books showing interiors. These mats fit tightly, and the
        floor upon which they rest, never being in sight, is generally made
        of rough boards with open joints. The mat, as you step upon it,
        yields slightly to the pressure of the foot; and old mats get to be
        slightly uneven and somewhat hard from continual use. From the nature
        of this soft-matted floor shoes are never worn upon it,‚Äîthe Japanese
        invariably leaving their wooden clogs outside the house, either on
        the stepping-stones or on the earth-floor at the entrance. The
        wearing of one's shoes in the house is one of the many coarse and
        rude ways in which a foreigner is likely to offend these people. The
        hard heels of a boot or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span> shoe not only leave deep indentations in the upper
        matting, but oftentimes break through. Happily, however, the act of
        removing one's shoes on entering the house is one of the very few
        customs that foreigners recognize,‚Äîthe necessity of compliance being
        too obvious to dispute. In spring-time, or during a rain of long
        duration, the mats become damp and musty; and when a day of sunshine
        comes they are taken up and stacked, like cards, in front of the
        house to dry. They are also removed at times and well beaten. Their
        very nature affords abundant hiding-places for fleas, which are the
        unmitigated misery of foreigners who travel in Japan; though even
        this annoyance is generally absent in private houses of the better
        classes, as is the case with similar pests in our country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon these mats
        the people eat, sleep, and die; they represent the bed, chair,
        lounge, and sometimes table, combined. In resting upon them the
        Japanese assume a kneeling position,‚Äîthe legs turned beneath, and the
        haunches resting upon the calves of the legs and the inner sides of
        the heels; the toes turned in so that the upper and outer part of the
        instep bears directly on the mats. <a href="#myfig102" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 102</span></a>
        represents a woman in the attitude of sitting. In old people one
        often notices a callosity on that part of the foot which comes in
        contact with the mat, and but for a knowledge of the customs of the
        people in this matter might well wonder how such a hardening of the
        flesh could occur in such an odd place. This position is so painful
        to a foreigner that it is only with a great deal of practice he can
        become accustomed to it. Even the Japanese who have been abroad for
        several years find it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
        125]</span> excessively difficult and painful to resume this habit.
        In this attitude the Japanese receive their company. Hand-shaking is
        unknown, but bows of various degrees of profundity are made by
        placing the hands together upon the mats and bowing until the head
        oftentimes touches the hands. In this ceremony the back is kept
        parallel with the floor, or nearly so.</p>

        food is served in lacquer and porcelain dishes on lacquer trays,
        placed upon the floor in front of the kneeling family; and in this
        position the repast is taken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At night a heavily
        wadded comforter is placed upon the floor; another equally thick is
        provided for a blanket, a pillow of diminutive proportions for a
        head-support,‚Äîand the bed is made. In the morning these articles are
        stowed away in a large closet. Further reference will be made to
        bedding in the proper place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A good quality of
        mats can be made for one dollar and a half a-piece; though they
        sometimes cost three or four dollars, and even a higher price. The
        poorest mats cost from sixty to eighty cents a-piece. The matting for
        the entire house represented in plan <a href="#myfig097" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 97</span></a> cost
        fifty-two dollars and fifty cents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reference has
        already been made to the sliding screens, and as they form so
        important and distinct a feature in the Japanese house, a more
        special description of them is necessary. In our American houses a
        lintel is the horizontal beam placed over the door; this is cased
        with wood, and has a jamb or recess corresponding to the vertical
        recesses into which the door shuts. For the sake of clearness, we may
        imagine a lintel running entirely across the room from one corner to
        the other, and this is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kamoi</span></em> of the Japanese room. The beam
        is not cased. On its under surface run two deep and closely parallel
        grooves, and directly beneath this <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kamoi</span></em> on
        the floor a surface of wood shows in which are two exceedingly
        shallow grooves. This surface is level with the mats; and in these
        grooves the screens run. The grooves in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page126">[pg 126]</span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kamoi</span></em> are made deep, in order that
        the screens may be lifted out of the floor-grooves and then dropped
        from the upper ones, and thus removed. In this way a suite of rooms
        can be quickly turned into one, by the removal of the screens. The
        grooves are sufficiently wide apart to permit the screens being
        pushed by each other. From the adjustable nature of these sliding
        partitions one may have the opening between the rooms of any width he
        desires.</p>

        "page127">[pg 127]</span> customary in past times to use Chinese
        paper for this purpose, these devices are also called <em class=

        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúChina-paper.‚Äù</span> The frame is not unlike the frame
        used for the outside screens, consisting of thin vertical and
        horizontal strips of wood forming a grating, with the meshes four or
        five inches in width, and two inches in height. The outside frame or
        border is usually left plain, as is the case with most of their
        wood-work. It is not uncommon, however, to see these frames
        lacquered. The material used for covering them consists of a stout,
        thick, and durable paper; and this is often richly decorated.
        Sometimes a continuous scene will stretch like a panorama across the
        whole side of a room. The old castles contain some celebrated
        paintings on these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em> by famous artists. The use
        of heavy gold-leaf in combination with the paintings produces a
        decorative effect rich beyond description. In the commoner houses the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> are often undecorated save by
        the paper which covers them; and the material for this purpose is
        infinite in its variety,‚Äîsome kinds being curiously wrinkled, other
        kinds seeming to have interwoven in their texture the delicate green
        threads of some sea-weed; while other kinds still will have the rich
        brown sheaths of bamboo shoots worked into the paper, producing a
        quaint and pleasing effect. Often the paper is perfectly plain; and
        if by chance an artist friend comes to the house, he is asked to
        leave some little sketch upon these surfaces as a memento of his
        visit: others perhaps may have already covered portions of the
        surface with some landscape or spray of flowers. In old inns one has
        often pointed out to him the work of some famous artist, who probably
        paid his score in this way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> are almost invariably covered
        with thick and opaque paper, it occurs sometimes that light is
        required in a back-room; in that case, while the upper and lower
        third of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> retains its usual character,
        the central third has a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> inserted,‚Äîthat is, a slight
        frame-work covered with white paper, through which light enters as in
        the outside screens. This frame <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page128">[pg 128]</span> is removable, so that it can be re-covered
        with paper when required. This frame-work is often made in ornamental
        patterns, geometrical or natural designs being common. In summer
        another kind of frame may be substituted in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em>
        termed a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi-do,</span></em> in which a kind of rush
        called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi</span></em> takes the place of paper; the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi</span></em> is arranged in a close grating
        through which the air has free access and a little light may enter.
        The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> may be entirely composed of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi</span></em> and the appropriate frame-work
        to hold it. One of this kind is represented in <a href="#myfig104"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 104</span></a>.
        The lower portion consists of a panel of dark cedar, in which are cut
        or perforated the figures of bats; above this panel are transverse
        bars of light cedar, and filling up the border of the frame is a
        close grating of brown reeds or rushes placed vertically; at the top
        is a wide interspace crossed by a single root of bamboo. The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yoshi</span></em> resembles miniature bamboo,
        the rods being the size of an ordinary wheat-straw, and having a warm
        brown tint. This is employed in many ways in the decoration of
        interiors, and the use of so fragile and delicate a material in
        house-finish is one of the many indications of the quiet and gentle
        manners of the Japanese.</p>

        cheaper forms of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em> the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hikite</span></em>
        consists <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span> of a
        depressed area in the paper formed by a modification of the frame
        itself. In illustrations of fine interiors one often notices a form
        of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hikite</span></em> from which hang two short
        cords of silk tied in certain formal ways, on the ends of which are
        tassels. From the almost universal presence of these in old
        illustrated books, one is led to believe that formerly the cord was
        the usual handle by which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> was pulled back and forth,
        and that these gradually fell into disuse, the recessed plate of
        metal alone remaining. This form of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hikite</span></em> is
        rarely seen to-day, though a few of the old Daimios' houses still
        possess it. <a href="#myfig110" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em> which take the place of our
        windows, are those screens which border the verandah, or come on that
        side of the room towards the exterior wall of the house. These
        consist of a light frame-work made of thin bars of wood crossing and
        matched into each other, leaving small rectangular interspaces. The
        lower portion of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em> to the height of a foot from
        the floor, is usually a wood-panel, as a protection against careless
        feet as well as to strengthen the frame. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> are
        covered on the outside with white paper. The only light the room
        receives when the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg

        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> are closed comes through this
        paper, and the room is flooded with a soft diffused light which is
        very agreeable. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em>
        back is arranged by one of the rectangular spaces being papered on
        the opposite side, thus leaving a convenient recess for the
        fingers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes little

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji;</span></em> and in the mending of these
        places the Japanese, ever true in their artistic feeling, repair the
        damage, not by square bits of paper as we should probably, but by
        cutting out pretty designs of cherry or plum blossoms and patching
        the rents with these. When observing this artistic device I have
        often wondered how the broken panes of some of our country houses
        must look to a Japanese,‚Äîthe repairs being effected by the use of
        dirty bags stuffed with straw, or more commonly by battered hats
        jammed into the gaps. Sometimes the frame of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em>
        gets sprung or thrown out of its true rectangular shape; this is
        remedied by inserting at intervals in the meshes of the frame-work
        elastic strips of bamboo, and the constant pressure of these strips
        in one direction tends to bring the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page132">[pg 132]</span> frame straight again. <a href="#myfig111"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 111</span></a>
        illustrates the appearance of this; the curved lines representing the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
        innumerable designs employed in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji;</span></em>
        and in this, as in many other parts of the interior, the Japanese
        show an infinite amount of taste and ingenuity. <a href="#myfig112"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 112</span></a>
        illustrates one of these ornamental forms. At present in the cities
        it is common to see a narrow strip of window glass inserted across
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> about two feet from the floor.
        It seems odd at first sight to see it placed so low, until one
        recalls the fact that the inmates sit on the mats, and the glass in
        this position is on a level with their line of vision. As a general
        rule the designs for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> are more simple than those
        employed for certain exterior openings which may be regarded as
        windows, while those which cover the openings between the rooms are
        most complex and elaborate. Further reference, however, will be made
        to these in the proper place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        necessary to anticipate the special description of the details of a
        room in so far as a description of the mats and screens were
        concerned, since a general idea of the interior <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span> could not be well
        understood without clearly understanding the nature of those objects
        which form inseparable elements of every Japanese room, and which are
        so unlike anything to which we are accustomed. Having given these
        features, it may be well to glance at a general view of the few
        typical rooms before examining farther into the details of their
        finish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room shown in
        <a href="#myfig096" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 96</span></a> gives a fair idea of the appearance
        of the guest-room with its two bays or recesses, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana,</span></em>‚Äîone of which, the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em> is a clear recess, in
        which usually hangs a picture; and in the other is a small closet and
        shelf, and an additional shelf above, closed by sliding doors. The
        sketch was taken from the adjoining room, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em>
        between the two having been removed. The grooves for the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em>
        may be seen in the floor and in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kamoi</span></em>
        overhead. The farther recess is called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em>
        which means literally, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbed-space.‚Äù</span>
        This recess, or at least its raised platform, is supposed to have
        been anciently used for the bed-place.<a id="noteref_15" name=
        "noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us pause for a
        moment to consider the peculiar features of this room. The partition
        separating the two recesses has for its post a stick of timber, from
        which the bark only has been removed; and this post, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">toko-bashira</span></em> as it is called, is
        almost invariably a stick of wood in its natural state, or with the
        bark only removed; and if it is gnarled, or tortuous in grain, or if
        it presents knots or burls, it is all the more desirable. Sometimes
        the post may be hewn in such a way that in section it has an
        octagonal form,‚Äîthe cutting being done in broad scarfs, giving it a
        peculiar appearance as shown in <a href="#myfig113" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 113</span></a>.
        Sometimes the post may have one or two branches above, which are
        worked into the structure as an ornamental feature. The ceiling of
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> is usually, if not always,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span> flush, with the
        ceiling of the room, while that of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> is much lower. The floor
        of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> is higher than that of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana,</span></em> and its sill may be
        rough or finished; and even when finished squarely, some natural
        surface may be left through the curvature of the stick from which it
        has been hewn, and which had been selected for this very
        peculiarity,‚Äîa feature, by the way, that our carpenters would regard
        as a blemish. The floor of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> is in nearly every case a
        polished plank; the floor of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em>
        is also of polished wood. A large and deep <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        may have a mat, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tatami,</span></em> fitted into the floor; and
        this is generally bordered with a white strip, and not with black as
        in the floor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tatami.</span></em> The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tatami</span></em> in
        this place is found in the houses of the Daimios.</p>

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> at a somewhat lower
        level. When the cross-beam of the <em class=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">toko-bashira,</span></em> as well as in the
        joining of other horizontal beams with the uprights,
        ornamental-headed nails are used. These are often of
        elaborately-wrought metal, representing a variety of natural or
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span> conventional
        forms. Figs. 114, 115, 116, and 117 present a few of the cheaper
        forms used; these being of cast metal, the finer lines only having
        been cut by hand. These nails, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kazari-kugi,</span></em> are strictly
        ornamental, having only a spur behind to hold them into the wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The partition
        dividing these two recesses often has an ornamental opening, either
        in the form of a small window barred with bamboo, or left open; or
        this opening may be near the floor, with its border made of a curved
        stick of wood, as in the figure we are now describing.</p>

        more shelves ranged in an alternating manner, with usually a
        continuous shelf above closed by sliding doors. A little closet on
        the floor in the corner of the recess is also closed by screens, as
        shown in the figure. The wood-work of this may be quaintly-shaped
        sticks or highly-polished wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This room
        illustrates very clearly a peculiar feature in Japanese
        decoration,‚Äîthat of avoiding, as far as possible, bi-lateral
        symmetry. Here are two rooms of the same size and shape, the only
        difference consisting in the farther room having two recesses, while
        the room nearer has a large closet closed by sliding screens. It will
        be observed, however, that in the farther room the narrow strips of
        wood, upon which the boards of the ceiling rest, run parallel to the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em> while in the nearer room
        the strips run at right angles. The mats in the two rooms, while
        arranged in the usual manner for an eight-mat room, are placed in
        opposite ways; that is to say, as the mats in front of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> are always parallel to
        these recesses, the other mats are arranged in accordance with these.

        same, have the two mats running parallel to the line dividing the
        rooms, and of course the other mats in accordance with these. This
        asymmetry is carried out, of course, in the two <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span> recesses, which are unlike
        in every detail,‚Äîtheir floors as well as the lower borders of their
        hanging partitions being at different levels. And in the details of
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> symmetrical arrangement
        is almost invariably avoided, the little closet on the floor being at
        one side, while a shelf supported on a single prop runs from the
        corner of this closet to the other side of the recess; and if another
        shelf is added, this is arranged in an equally unsymmetrical manner.
        In fact everywhere, in mats, ceiling, and other details, a two-sided
        symmetry is carefully avoided.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How different has
        been the treatment of similar features in the finish of American
        rooms! Everywhere in our apartments, halls, school-houses, inside and
        out, a monotonous bi-lateral symmetry is elaborated to the minutest
        particular, even to bracket and notch in pairs. The fireplace is in
        the middle of the room, the mantel, and all the work about this
        opening, duplicated with painful accuracy on each side of a median
        line; every ornament on the mantel-shelf is in pairs, and these are
        arranged in the same way; a single object, like a French clock, is
        adjusted in the dead centre of this shelf, so that each half of the
        mantel shall get its half of a clock; a pair of andirons below, and
        portraits of ancestral progenitors on each side above keep up this
        intolerable monotony; and opposite, two windows with draped curtains
        parted right and left, and a symmetrical table or cabinet between the
        two, are in rigid adherence to this senseless scheme. And outside the
        monotony is still more dreadful, even to the fences, carriage-way and
        flower-beds; indeed, false windows are introduced in adherence to
        this inane persistency in traditional methods. Within ten years some
        progress has been made among the better class of American houses in
        breaking away from this false and tiresome idea, and our houses look
        all the prettier for these changes. In decoration, as well, we have
        made great strides in the same direction, thanks to the influence of
        Japanese methods.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg

        typical of the prevailing features of these recesses, nevertheless
        their forms and peculiarities are infinitely varied. It is indeed

        as will be seen by a study of the figures which are to follow.
        Usually these two recesses are side by side, and run at right angles

        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthin mist-shelf,‚Äù</span>‚Äîthe shelves in this

        the form of shelf, and the lower outline the conventional drawing of

        "font-style: italic">ichi-yo-dana;</span></em> the form of the shelf
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span> suggests such
        names as willow-leaf shelf, fish-shelf, etc. In this recess, as we
        have seen, are usually shelves and a cupboard; and the arrangements
        of these are almost as numberless as the houses containing them,‚Äîat
        least it is rare to see two alike. A shelf in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana,</span></em> having a rib or raised
        portion on its free end, is called a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">maki-mono-dana.</span></em> On this shelf the
        long picture-scrolls called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">maki-mono</span></em> are placed; the ceremonial
        hat was also placed on one of the shelves. It was customary to place
        on top of the cupboard a lacquer-box, in which was contained an
        ink-stone, brushes, and paper. This box was usually very rich in its
        gold lacquer and design. In the houses of the nobles the top of the
        cupboard was also used to hold a wooden tablet called a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shaku,</span></em>‚Äîan
        object carried by the nobles in former times, when in the presence of
        the Emperor. It was anciently used to make memoranda upon, but in
        later days is carried only as a form of court etiquette. The
        sword-rack might also be placed on the cupboard. In honor of
        distinguished guests the sword-rack was placed in the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span> <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">toko,</span></em> in front of the hanging
        picture,‚Äîthough if an incense-burner occupied this position, then the
        sword-rack was placed at one side. While these recesses were usually
        finished with wood in its natural state or simply planed, in the
        houses of the nobles this finish was often richly lacquered.</p>

        filling half the side of the room bordering the verandah. In this
        partition was a large circular window, having a graceful bamboo

        story of the house of a famous potter in Kioto. This room
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span> was remarkable
        for the purity of its finish. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=

        unusually twisted stick of some kind of hard wood, the bark having

        of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> was a black post hewn in
        an octagonal shape, with curious irregular crosscuts on the faces.
        The sliding doors closing the shelf in this recess were covered with
        gold paper. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hikite</span></em> consisted of sections of
        bamboo let in to the surface. The plaster of both recesses was a

        "tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span> of large square panels of
        old cedar richly grained. This room was comparatively modern, having

        "color: blue">fig. 128</span></a>) represents a room in a country
        house of the poorer class. The recesses were of the plainest
        description. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> was modified in a curious
        way by a break in the partition above, and beneath, this modification
        was a shelf wrought out of a black, worm-eaten plank from
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span> some old
        shipwreck. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> had an angular-shaped
        shelf in one of its corners, and in the other corner two little
        shelves supported by a post. The floor of this recess was on a level
        with the mats, while the floor of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        was only slightly raised above this level.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The figures of
        interiors thus far given present some idea of the infinite variety of
        design seen in the two recesses which characterize the best room in
        the house. The typical form having been shown in <a href="#myfig096"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 96</span></a>, it
        will be seen how far these bays may vary in form and structure while
        still possessing the distinguishing features of the <em class=

        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        hangs the ever present scroll, upon which may be a picture; or it may
        present a number of Chinese characters which convey some moral
        precept, or lines from some classical poem. On its floor rests the
        vase for flowers, a figure in pottery, an incense burner, a fragment
        of quartz, or other object, these being often supported by a lacquer
        stand. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> convenient shelves and
        closets are arranged in a variety of ways, to be used for a variety

        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> may have in its back
        wall an opening either circular, crescent-shaped, or of some other
        form, from which a pleasing view is obtained either of the garden
        below or some distant range beyond.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
        examined the room which would parallel our drawing-room or parlor;
        the other rooms vary from this in being smaller, and having, of
        course, no recesses such as have been described. By an examination of
        the plans given in the first part of this chapter, it will be seen
        how very simple many of the rooms are,‚Äîsometimes having a recess for
        a case of drawers or shelves; a closet, possibly, but nothing else to
        break the rectangular outline, which may be bounded on all sides by
        the sliding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em> or have one or more
        permanent partitions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another class of
        rooms may here be considered, the details of which are more severely
        simple even than those of the rooms just described. These apartments
        are constructed expressly for ceremonial tea-parties. A volume might
        be filled with a description of the various forms of buildings
        connected with these observances; and indeed another volume might be
        filled with the minor details associated with their different
        schools.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In brief, the
        party comes about by the host inviting a company of four to attend
        the tea-ceremony, and in their presence making the tea in a bowl
        after certain prescribed forms, and offering it to the guests. To be
        more explicit as to the mode of conducting this ceremony,‚Äîthe tea is
        first prepared by grinding it to a fine, almost impalpable, powder.
        This may be done by a servant before the assemblage of the guests, or
        may be ordered ground from a tea shop; indeed, the host may grind it
        himself. This material, always freshly ground for each party, is
        usually kept in a little earthen jar, having an ivory cover,‚Äîthe
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span> well-known
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cha-ire</span></em> of the collector.
        Lacquer-boxes may also be used for this purpose. The principal
        utensils used in the ceremony consist of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">furo,</span></em> or
        fire-pot, made of pottery (or use may be made of a depression in the
        floor partially filled with ashes, in which the charcoal may be
        placed); an iron kettle to boil the water in; a bamboo dipper of the
        most delicate construction, to dip out the water; a wide-mouthed jar,
        from which to replenish the water in the kettle; a bowl, in which the
        tea is made; a bamboo spoon, to dip out the powdered tea; a bamboo
        stirrer, not unlike certain forms of egg-beaters, by which the tea is
        briskly stirred after the hot water has been added; a square silk
        cloth, with which to wipe the jar and spoon properly; a little rest
        for the tea-kettle cover, made of pottery or bronze or section of
        bamboo; a shallow vessel, in which the rinsings of the tea-bowl are
        poured after washing; a brush, consisting of three feathers of the
        eagle or some other large bird, to dust the edge of the fire-vessel;
        and finally a shallow basket, in which is not only charcoal to
        replenish the fire, but a pair of metal rods or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hibashi</span></em>
        to handle the coal, two interrupted metal rings by which the kettle
        is lifted off the fire, a circular mat upon which the kettle is
        placed, and a small box containing incense, or bits of wood that give
        out a peculiar fragrance when burned. With the exception of the
        fire-vessel and an iron kettle, all these utensils have to be brought
        in by the host with great formality and in a certain sequence, and
        placed with great precision upon the mats after the prescribed rules
        of certain schools. In the making of the tea, the utensils are used
        in a most exact and formal manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The making of the
        tea, watched by one knowing nothing about the ceremony, seems as
        grotesque a performance as one can well imagine. Many of the forms
        connected with it seem uselessly absurd; and yet having taken many
        lessons in the art of tea-making, I found that with few exceptions it
        was natural <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span> and
        easy; and the guests assembled on such an occasion, though at first
        sight appearing stiff, are always perfectly at their ease. The proper
        placing of the utensils, and the sequence in handling them and making
        the tea are all natural and easy movements, as I have said. The light
        wiping of the tea-jar, and the washing of the bowl and its wiping
        with so many peripheral jerks, the dropping of the stirrer against
        the side of the bowl with a click in rinsing, and a few of the other
        usual movements are certainly grotesquely formal enough; but I
        question whether the etiquette of a ceremonious dinner-party at home,
        with the decorum observed in the proper use of each utensil, does not
        strike a Japanese as equally odd and incomprehensible when
        experienced by him for the first time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This very brief
        and imperfect allusion has been made in order to explain, that so
        highly do the Japanese regard this ceremony that little isolated
        houses are specially constructed for the express purpose of
        entertaining tea-parties. If no house is allotted for the purpose,
        then a special room is fitted for it. Many books are devoted to the
        exposition of the different schools of tea-ceremonies, illustrated
        with diagrams showing the various ways of placing the utensils, plans
        of the tea-rooms, and all the details involved in the
        observances.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tea-ceremonies
        have had a profound influence on many Japanese arts. Particularly
        have they affected the pottery of Japan; for the rigid simplicity,
        approaching an affected roughness and poverty, which characterizes
        the tea-room and many of the utensils used in the ceremony, has left
        its impress upon many forms of pottery. It has also had an influence
        on even the few rustic and simple adornments allowed in the room, and
        has held its sway over the gardens, gateways, and fences surrounding
        the house. Indeed, it has had an effect on the Japanese almost equal
        to that of Calvinistic doctrines on the early Puritans. The one
        suppressed the exuberance of an <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page152">[pg 152]</span> art-loving people, and brought many of
        their decorative impulses down to a restful purity and simplicity;
        but in the case of the Puritans and their immediate descendants, who
        had but little of the art-spirit to spare, their sombre dogmas
        crushed the little love for art that might have dawned, and rendered
        intolerably woful and sepulchral the lives and homes of our
        ancestors; and when some faint groping for art and adornment here and
        there appeared, it manifested itself only in wretched samplers and
        hideous tomb-stones, with tearful willow or death-bed scenes done in
        cold steel. Whittier gives a good picture of such a home, in his poem

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we are
        digressing. Having given some idea of the formal character of the
        tea-ceremonies, it is not to be wondered at that special rooms, and
        even special buildings, should be designed and built expressly for
        those observances. We give a few illustrations of the interiors of
        rooms used for this purpose.</p>

        "#myfig130" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        130</span></a> is that of a room in Nan-en-ji temple, in Kioto, said
        to have been specially designed, in the early part of the seventeenth
        century, by Kobori Yenshiu,‚Äîa famous master of tea-ceremonies, and a
        founder of one of its schools. The room was exceedingly small, a four
        and a half mat room I believe, which is the usual size. The drawing,
        from necessity of perspective, makes it appear much larger. The
        ceiling was of rush and bamboo; the walls were roughly plastered with
        bluish-gray clay; the cross-ties and uprights were of pine, with the
        bark retained. The room had eight small windows of various sizes,
        placed at various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
        154]</span> heights in different parts of the room; and this was in
        accordance with Yenshiu's taste. Only one recess, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em>
        is seen in the room,‚Äîin which may hang at the time of a party a
        picture, to be replaced, at a certain period of the ceremony, by a
        hanging basket of flowers. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ro,</span></em> or fireplace, is a depressed
        area in the floor, deep enough to hold a considerable amount of
        ashes, as well as a tripod upon which the kettle rests.</p>

        compared with the one first described. The ceiling consisted of a
        matting of thin wood-strips, bamboo and red pine being used for the

        134</span></a> is given the view of a room in a Tokio house that was
        extremely ornate in its finish. The owner of the house had built it
        some thirty years before, and had intended carrying out Chinese ideas
        of design and furnishing. Whether he had got his ideas from books, or
        had evolved them from his inner consciousness, I do not know; certain
        it is, that although he had worked into its structure a number of
        features actually <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
        157]</span> brought from China, I must say that in my limited
        observations in that country I saw nothing approaching such an
        interior or building. The effect of the room was certainly charming,
        and the most elaborate finish with expensive woods had been employed
        in its construction. It seemed altogether too ornamental for the
        tea-ceremonies to suit the Japanese taste. The ceiling was
        particularly unique; for running diagonally across it from one corner
        to the other was a stout bamboo in two curves, and upon this bamboo
        was engraved a Chinese poem. The ceiling on one side of the bamboo
        was finished in large square panels of an elaborately-grained wood;
        on the other side were small panels of cedar. Exotic woods, palms,
        bamboo, and red-pine were used for cross-ties <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span> and uprights. The panels of
        the little closet in some cases had beautiful designs painted upon
        them; other panels were of wood, with the designs inlaid in various
        colored woods,‚Äîthe musical instrument, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">biwa,</span></em>
        shown in the sketch, being inlaid in this way. The walls were tinted
        a sober brown. It was certainly one of the most unique interiors that
        I saw in Japan. To the right of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        the apartment opened into a small entry which led to a flight of
        stairs,‚Äîfor this room was in the second story of the house. The
        corner of the room, as it appeared from the <em class=

        is shown in <a href="#myfig135" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        shows in fig. 134) opened on the roof of the entrance below; another
        narrower and higher window opened on the roof of an L. In the little
        recess, which has for a corner-post a crooked stick,‚Äîthe crook
        forming one border of an opening in the corner.‚Äîwas hung a picture or

        represents a room of this nature in a shop in Kawagoye, in Musashi,
        nearly three hundred years old. Two long, low windows, opening on the
        street, were deeply recessed and heavily barred; above these openings
        were low deep cupboards, closed by long sliding doors. The room was
        dusty and unused, but I could not help noticing in this old building,
        as in the old buildings at home, the heavy character of the framework
        where it appeared in sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reference has been
        made to the fact that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> or fire-proof buildings, are
        often fitted up for living-rooms. <a href="#myfig137" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 137</span></a> (see page

        75 (<a href="#myfig057" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 57</span></a>). It has already been stated that
        the walls of such a building are of great thickness, and that one
        small window and doorway are often the only openings in the room. The
        walls are consequently cold and damp at certain seasons of the
        year.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the fitting up
        of such a room, to adapt it for a living-place, a light frame-work of
        bamboo is constructed, which stands away from the walls at a distance
        of two or three feet; upon this, cloth is stretched like a curtain.
        The frame-work forms a ceiling as well, so that the rough walls and
        beams of the floor above are concealed by this device. At one side
        the cloth is arranged to be looped up like a curtain, so that one may
        pass outside the drapery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The owner of this
        apartment was an eminent antiquarian, and the walls of the room were
        lined with shelves and cases which were filled with old books and
        pictures, rare scrolls, and bric-a-brac. A loft above, to which
        access was gained by a perilous flight of steps, was filled with
        ancient relics of all kinds,‚Äîstone implements, old pottery, quaint
        writing-desks, and rare manuscripts. The cloth which formed this
        supplementary partition was of a light, thin texture; and when the
        owner went in search of some object on the other side of it, I could
        trace him by his candle-light <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page160">[pg 160]</span> as he wandered about behind the curtain.
        The furniture us in the room, and shown in the sketch,‚Äîconsisting of

        past times is evident in the fact that old books not only represent
        this method in their pictures, but special details of the
        construction of the framework are given. In an old book in the
        possession of Mr. K‚Äî‚Äî, published one hundred and eighty years ago, a
        figure of one of these frames is given, with all the details of its

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with
        this room, and the manner of looping up the curtains at the side, I
        got from this scholar the first rational explanation of the meaning
        of the two narrow bands which hang down from the upper part of the
        usual form of a Japanese <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
        161]</span> picture,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kake-mono.</span></em> That these were survivals
        of useful appendages,‚Äîrudimentary organs, so to speak, there could be
        no doubt. Mr. K‚Äî‚Äîtold me that in former times the pictures, mainly of
        a religious character, were suspended from a frame. Long bands
        trailed down behind the picture; and shorter ones, so as not to
        obscure it, hung down in front. When the picture was rolled up, it
        was held in position by tying these bands. When the custom came to
        hang these pictures permanently against the wall, the long bands were
        finally discarded, while the shorter ones in front survived. In old
        books there are illustrated methods by which curtain-like screens
        hanging on frames were tied up in this way,‚Äîthe long bands being
        behind, and the short ones showing in front. When the wind blew
        through the apartment the curtains were tied up; and, curiously
        enough, the bands on a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kake-mono</span></em> are called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">f≈´-tai,</span></em>
        or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kaze-obi,</span></em> which literally means
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwind-bands.‚Äù</span> This is the explanation
        given me; but it is quite probable that large pictures hanging
        against the walls, when disturbed by the wind, were tied up by these
        bands.</p>

        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        store-room, taking the place of the country attic; and one may find
        here bundles of dried herbs, corn, an old spinning-wheel, chests, and
        indeed just such objects as ultimately find a resting-place in our
        attics at home. In this section it would have been more systematic to
        deal with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> separately; but in the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span> description of
        interiors, it was difficult to describe them without including under
        the same consideration these recesses, as they form an integral part
        of the principal room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my remarks on
        house-construction, reference was made to the ceiling and the way in
        which it is made and held in place, the form of ceiling there
        described being the almost universal one throughout the country. The
        Japanese word for ceiling is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tenjo,</span></em>‚Äîliterally, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúheaven's well.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In selecting wood
        for the ceiling, great care is taken to secure boards in which the
        grain is perfectly even and regular, with no signs of knots. A wood
        much prized for the ceiling, as well as for other interior finish, is
        a kind of cedar dug up from swamps in Hakone, and other places in
        Japan. It is of a rich, warm gray or brown color; and oftentimes
        planks of enormous thickness are secured for this purpose. This wood
        is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Jin-dai-sugi,</span></em> meaning <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúcedar of God's age.‚Äù</span> A wood called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hi-no-ki</span></em>
        is often used for ceilings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is rare to see
        a ceiling differing from the conventional form, consisting of light,
        thin, square strips as ceiling-beams, upon which rest crosswise thin
        planks of wood with their edges overlapping. One sees this form of
        ceiling everywhere, from north to south, in inns, private dwellings,
        and shops. This form is as universal in Japan as is the ordinary
        white plaster-ceiling with us. In many other forms of ceiling,
        however, wood of the most tortuous grain is preferred.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the little
        houses made for the tea-parties the ceiling is often of some rustic
        design,‚Äîeither a layer of rush resting on bamboo rafters, or thin,
        wide strips of wood braided or matted like basket-work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
        ceiling instead of being flat is arching; that is, the sides run up
        like a roof, and meet above in a flat panel, or the ceiling may be
        made up of panels either square or angular.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very elaborate
        and beautiful ceiling is seen in <a href="#myfig127" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 127</span></a> (see page
        146). The structure is supposed to be in imitation of country
        thatched roof. The centre panel consists of a huge plank of cedar,
        the irregular grain cut out in such a way as to show the lines in
        high-relief, giving it the appearance of very old wood, in which the
        softer lines have been worn away. The round sticks which form the
        frame for the plank, and those bordering the ceiling, as well as
        those running from the corners of the ceiling to the corners of the
        plank, are of red pine with the bark unremoved. The radiating rafters
        are of large yellow bamboo, while the smaller beams running parallel
        to the sides of the room consist of small dark-brown and polished
        bamboo; the body of the ceiling is made up of a brown rush, called
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hagi</span></em>,‚Äîthis representing the thatch.
        This ceiling was simply charming; it was clean, pure, and effective;
        it gave the room a lofty appearance, and was moreover thoroughly
        constructive. Our architects might well imitate it without the
        modification of a single feature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceiling
        figured on page 156 (<a href="#myfig134" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 134</span></a>)
        consisted of square panels of cedar, arranged on either side of a
        double curved bamboo, which ran across the ceiling diagonally from
        one corner of the room to another. Upon the bamboo was engraved a
        Chinese poem, in beautiful characters. The beauty of this ceiling
        consisted not only in its general quaint effect, but in the rich
        woods and good workmanship everywhere displayed in its construction.
        The same might be said of the ceiling shown in fig. 126 (see page
        145); here, indeed, the whole room was like <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page167">[pg 167]</span> a choice cabinet. Lately, these panelled
        ceilings have come more into use. <a href="#myfig143" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 143</span></a>
        represents a form of ceiling which may be occasionally seen,
        consisting of large, square planks of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sugi</span></em>,
        with a framework of bamboo or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">keyaki</span></em> wood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems a little
        curious that the space enclosed under the roof (a garret in fact) is
        rarely, if ever, utilized. Here the rats hold high carnival at night;
        and one finds it difficult to sleep, on account of the racket these
        pests keep up in racing and fighting upon the thin and resonant
        boards composing the ceiling. The rats make a thoroughfare of the
        beam which runs across the end of the house from one corner to the
        other; and this beam is called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nedzumi-bashira,</span></em>‚Äîliterally,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúrat-post.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In my remarks on
        house-construction I made mention of the plaster walls, and of the
        various colored sands used in the plaster. There are many ways of
        treating this surface, by which curious effects are obtained. Little
        gray and white pebbles are sometimes mixed with the plaster. The
        shells of a little fresh-water bivalve (<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Corbicula</span></em>) are pounded into
        fragments and mixed with the plaster. In the province of Mikawa I saw
        an iron-gray plaster, in which had been mixed the short fibres of
        finely-chopped hemp, the fibres glistening in the plaster; the effect
        was odd and striking. In the province of Omi it was not unusual to
        see white plastered surfaces smoothly finished, in which iron-dust
        had been blown evenly upon the surface while the plaster was yet
        moist, and, oxidizing, had given a warm brownish-yellow tint to the
        whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In papering
        plaster-walls rice-paste is not used, as the larvae of certain
        insects are liable to injure the surface. In lieu of this a kind of
        seaweed similar to Iceland moss is used, the mucilaginous portion of
        which forms the cement. This material is used in sizing paper, and
        also in the pasteboard or stiff paper which is made by sticking a
        number of sheets together.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page168">[pg 168]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plastered rooms
        are often papered; and even when the plaster is tinted and the
        plastered surface is left exposed, is customary to use a paper called
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">koshi-bari,</span></em> which is spread on the
        wall to a height of two feet or more in order to protect the clothes
        from the plaster. This treatment is seen in common rooms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simple and
        unpretending as the interior of a Japanese house appears to be, it is
        wonderful upon how many places in their apparently naked rooms the
        ingenuity and art-taste of the cabinet-maker can be expended.
        Naturally, the variety of design and finish of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> is unlimited save by the
        size of their areas; for with the sills and upright posts, the
        shelves and little closets, sliding-doors with their surfaces for the
        artists' brush, and the variety of woods employed, the artisan has a
        wide field in which to display his peculiar skill. The ceiling,
        though showing less variety in its structure, nevertheless presents a
        good field for decorative work, though any exploits in this direction
        outside the conventional form become very costly, on account of the
        large surface to deal with and the expensive cabinet-work required.
        Next to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> in decorative importance
        (excepting of course the ceiling, which, as we have already seen,
        rarely departs from the almost universal character of thin boards and
        transverse strips), I am inclined to believe that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ramma</span></em>
        receives the most attention from the designer, and requires more
        delicate work from the cabinet-maker. It is true that the areas to
        cover are small, yet the designs which may be carved or
        latticed,‚Äîgeometric designs in fret-work, or perforated designs in
        panel,‚Äîmust have a strength and prominence not shown in the other
        interior finishings of the room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kamoi,</span></em> or
        lintel, as we have seen, is a beam that runs entirely across the side
        of the room at the height of nearly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page169">[pg 169]</span> six feet from the floor (<a href=
        "#myfig103" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        103</span></a>). On its under surface are the grooves in which the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> run; between this beam and
        the ceiling is a space of two feet or more depending, of course, upon
        the height of the room. The height of the beam itself from the floor,
        a nearly constant factor, is always lower than are our doorways,
        because the average height of the Japanese people is less than ours;
        and aggravatingly low to many foreigners is this beam, as can be
        attested by those who have cracked their heads against it in passing
        from one room to another. The space between the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kamoi</span></em> and
        the ceiling is called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ramma,</span></em> and offers another field for
        the exercise of that decorative faculty which comes so naturally to
        the Japanese. This space may be occupied simply by a closed plastered
        partition, just as in our houses we invariably fill up a similar
        space which comes over wide folding doors between a suite of rooms.
        In the Japanese room, however, it is customary to divide this space
        into two or more panels,‚Äîusually two; and in this area the designer
        and wood-worker have ample room to carry out those charming surprises
        which are to be seen in Japanese interiors.</p>

        dark shadows of the room beyond as a back-ground to the design; or
        the design may be in the form of a thin panel of cedar, in which
        patterns <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span> of
        birds, flowers, waves, dragons, or other objects are cut out in

        requiring great skill in design and execution are those in which the
        wood-carver, having his design drawn upon a solid plank, cuts away
        all the wood about it, leaving the design free; and this is then
        delicately wrought.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an old house at
        Gojio, Yamato, is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ramma</span></em> having a single panel the
        length of the room. <a href="#myfig048" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 148</span></a>
        illustrates this design, which consists of chrysanthemums supported
        on a bamboo trellis, and was carved out of a single plank, the
        flowers and delicate tracery of the leaves being wrought with equal
        care on both sides; in fact, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ramma</span></em> in
        every case is designed to be seen from both rooms. I have often
        noticed that in quite old houses the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ramma</span></em> was
        of this description. In an old house at Yatsushiro, in Higo, I saw a
        very beautiful form of this nature (<a href="#myfig149" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 149</span></a>). The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ramma</span></em> was divided into two panels,
        and the design was continuous from one panel to the other. It
        represented a rustic method of conducting water by means of wooden
        troughs, propped up by branched sticks, and sticks tied together. The
        representation of long leaves of some aquatic plant, with their edges
        ragged by partial decay, was remarkably well rendered. The plank out
        of which the design was wrought must have been less than an inch in
        thickness, and yet the effect of relief was surprising. A white
        substance like chalk filled the interstices of the carving, giving
        the appearance that at one time the whole design had been whitened
        and the coloring <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span> matter had subsequently worn away. The house was quite
        old, and the work had been done by a local artist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a remarkable
        fact, and one well worth calling attention to, that in the smaller
        towns and villages, in regions far apart, there seem to be artistic
        workmen capable of designing and executing these graceful and
        artistic carvings,‚Äîfor such they certainly are. Everywhere throughout
        the Empire we find good work of all kinds, and evidence that workmen
        of all crafts have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">learned</span></em> their trades,‚Äînot
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúserved‚Äù</span> them,‚Äîand are employed at
        home. In other words, the people everywhere appreciate artistic
        designs and the proper execution of them; and, consequently, men
        capable in their various lines find their services in demand wherever
        they may be. I do not mean to imply by this general statement that
        good workmen in Japan are not drawn to the larger cities for
        employment, but rather that the smaller towns and villages everywhere
        are not destitute of such a class, and that the distribution of such
        artisans is far more wide and general than with us. And how different
        such conditions are with us may be seen in the fact that there are
        hundreds of towns and thousands of villages in our country where the
        carpenter is just capable of making a shelter from the weather; and
        if he attempts to beautify it‚Äîbut we will not awaken the recollection
        of those startling horrors of petticoat scallops fringing the eaves
        and every opening, and rendered, if possible, more hideous by the
        painter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the
        breadth and length of that land of thirty-six million people men
        capable of artistic work, and people capable of appreciating such
        work, abound. In our land of fifty-five millions one has to seek the
        great centres of population for similar work,‚Äîfor elsewhere the good
        work and its appreciation are exceptional.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Nagoya, in the
        house of a poor man, I saw a simple and ingenious form of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ramma,</span></em> in
        which two thin boards, one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg
        173]</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span> of
        light and the other of dark cedar, had been cut in the form of
        mountain contours. These were placed in juxtaposition, and from
        either side the appearance of two ranges of mountains was conveyed.

        the decoration and utilization for ventilating rooms through certain

        finish of our interiors.</p>

        of the functions of a window whatever. These openings assume an
        infinite variety of forms, and appear in the most surprising places
        in the room. They may be placed low down near the floor, or close to
        the ceiling; indeed, they occur between the rooms when permanent

        rests on grooved cleats or bars, which are fastened above and below
        the window, and oftentimes it runs inside the partition,‚Äîthat is, in
        a partition that is double. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        two portions, and parts to the right or left. The frame-work of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        marvel of exquisite taste. The designs are often geometric figures,
        as in <a href="#myfig152" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 152</span></a>; though other designs are seen, as
        in <a href="#myfig153" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        designs, being made of very thin strips of white pine, it would seem
        that in such examples portions of the frame-work must have been
        fastened to the paper to keep them in place, for there are no means

        thin cedar, in which was a perforated design of waves; the drawing
        was of the most graceful description. The curious, formal, curled
        tongues of water, like young sprouting ferns, the long graceful sweep
        of the waves, and the circular drops suspended above the breaking
        crests presented a charming effect, as the light coming through from

        fan-shaped; indeed, there seems to be no end to designs for these
        apertures. Openings of this nature between rooms may or may not have

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are hundreds
        of forms of these windows, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mado,</span></em> as they are called. The few to
        which allusion has been made serve to give one some idea of the
        almost entirely ornamental character of these openings. It is worthy
        of note that each form has its appropriate name, and books are
        specially prepared, giving many designs of windows and their modes of
        construction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the chapter on
        Gardens a few descriptions and sketches are given of other forms of
        windows belonging to summer-houses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The open character
        of the Japanese house has caused the development of a variety of
        forms of portable screens, bamboo shades, curtains, and the like,
        upon which much ingenuity of construction and an infinite amount of
        artistic talent have been expended. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">biy≈ç-bu,</span></em>
        or folding screens, are too well known to require more than a passing
        allusion. These consist of a number of panels or folds covered on
        both sides with stout paper. A narrow border of wood forms an outer
        frame, and this may be plain or lacquered. The end folds have the
        corners as well as other portions of its frame decorated with wrought
        metal pieces. Just within the frame runs a border of brocade of
        varying width, and on its inner edge a narrow strip of brocade;
        within this comes the panel or portion to receive the artist's
        efforts. Each fold or panel may have a separate picture upon it; or,
        as is most usually the case, a continuous landscape or composition
        covers the entire side of the screen. Many of the great artists of
        Japan have embodied some of their best works on screens of this kind,
        and the prices at which some of these are held are
        fabulous.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rich and
        heavily-gilded screens now so rare to obtain are marvels of
        decorative painting. While the front of the screen may have a broad
        landscape, the back may be simply a plain gold surface, or have some
        sketchy touches of bamboo, pine, etc., in black. I have been told
        that the gold-leaf was so thick on many of the old screens, that the
        sacrilege has often been committed of destroying them for the gold
        contained on their surfaces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The six-panelled
        gold-screen is, beyond all question, the richest object of household
        use for decorative purposes ever devised. There certainly is no other
        device in which so many decorative arts are called into play. The
        rich lacquered frame, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
        179]</span> the wrought metallic mountings, the border of gold
        brocade, and the great expanse for the artist's brush (for when both
        sides of a six-fold screen is decorated, an area is obtained nearly
        five feet in height and twenty-four feet in length) give great
        variety for richness of adornment. The rich, dead gold-leaf with
        which it is gilded softens the reflections, and gives a warm, radiant
        tone to the light. Its adjustable nature permits it to display its
        painting in every light. We refer now, of course, to the genuine old
        gold-screens which came in sets of two. One possessing a set of these
        screens may consider himself particularly fortunate. The one figured
        (<a href="#myfig155" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 155</span></a>) has depicted upon it a winter
        scene painted by Kano Tsunenobu, and is nearly one hundred and
        seventy years old; the companion of this has represented upon it a
        summer scene, by the same artist. On the reverse sides are painted
        with bright and vigorous touches the bamboo and pine. <a href=
        "#myfig156" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        156</span></a> shows one corner of the screen-frame with its metal
        mounting. These screens may have two folds, or three, or even six, as
        in this case. A set of screens when not in use are enclosed in silk
        bags, and then placed in a long, narrow wooden box (<a href=
        "#myfig157" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        157</span></a>). This box, like other articles of household use, such
        as bureaus and chests of drawers, has long hanging iron handles,
        which when turned upwards project above the level of the top, forming
        convenient loops through which a stick may be passed,‚Äîand thus in
        case of fire may be easily transported upon the shoulders of men.</p>

        or may be suspended just outside the room. They can be rolled up and
        tied, or dropped to any desired length. These curtains may be either
        plain or have traced upon them delicate designs of vines or gourds,
        or conventional patterns. These designs are produced either by the
        joints on the bamboo being adjusted to carry out a zigzag or other

        curtain is often seen in doorways and passageways, consisting of a
        fringe of cords, upon which have been strung like beads short
        sections of bamboo, with black seeds at intervals. A portion of one
        of these fringed curtains is illustrated in <a href="#myfig165"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 165</span></a>.
        Such a curtain has the advantage not only of being a good screen, but
        the inmates may pass through it, so to speak, without the necessity
        of lifting it. There are many forms of this curtain to be seen, and
        at present the Japanese are exporting a variety of delicate ones made
        of glass beads and sections of rushes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The kitchen, as an
        apartment, varies quite as much in Japan as it does in our country,
        and varies in the same way; that is to say, in the country, in houses
        of the better class, both in Japan and the United States, the kitchen
        is large and oftentimes spacious, well lighted and airy, in which not
        only the preparation of food and the washing of dishes go on, but in
        which also the meals are served. The kitchen of the common city house
        in both countries is oftentimes a dark narrow room, ill-lighted, and
        altogether devoid of comfort for the cook. Among this class of houses
        the kitchen is the least defined of Japanese rooms; it lacks that
        tidiness and definition so characteristic of the other rooms. It is
        often a narrow porch or shed with pent roof, rarely, if ever,
        possessing a ceiling; its exposed rafters are blackened by the smoke,
        which finds egress through a scuttle, through which often comes the
        only light that illuminates the dim interior. In the city house the
        kitchen often comes on that side of the house next the street, for
        the reason that the garden being in the rear of the house the best
        rooms face that area; being on the street too, the kitchen is
        convenient for the vender of fish and vegetables, and for all the
        kitchen traffic, which too often with us results in the strewing of
        our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span> little
        grass-plots with the wrapping paper of the butcher's bundles and
        other pleasing reminiscences of the day's dinner. In country the
        kitchen is generally at the end of the house usually opening into
        some porch-like expansion, where the tubs, bucket etc., and the
        winter's supply of wood finds convenient storage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In public inns and
        large country houses, and also in many of the larger city tea-houses,
        the customary raised floor is divided by a narrow area, which has for
        its floor the hard trodden earth; and this area forms an avenue from
        the road to the heart of the house, and even through the house to the
        garden beyond. This enables one to pass to the centre of the house
        without the necessity of removing one's shoes. Porters and servants
        bring the guest's baggage and deposit it directly upon the mats;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span> and in the inns
        more privacy is secured by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kago</span></em> being brought to the centre of
        the house, where the visitor may alight at the threshold of the very
        room he is to occupy. A plank or other adjustable platform is used to
        bridge this avenue, so that occupants may go from one portion of the
        house to another in their bare or stockinged feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this area is in
        a public inn, the office, common room, and kitchen border one side of
        this thoroughfare. In the common room the baby-tending, sewing, and
        the various duties of the family go on under the heavily-raftered and
        thatched roof, which blackened by the smoke from the kitchen fire,
        and festooned with equally blackened cobwebs, presents a weird
        appearance when lighted up by the ruddy glow from the hearth. We
        speak now of the northern country houses, particularly where the
        fireplace, as in the Aino house, is in the middle of the floor. In
        country houses of the better class the kitchen is large and roomy;
        the well is always conveniently near, and often under the same roof.
        An enormous quantity of water is used in the kitchen of a Japanese
        house; and if the well is outside, then a trough is arranged beside
        the well, into which the water is poured, and from this trough a
        bamboo spout conveys the water into a big water-tank within the
        kitchen. In the vicinity of the well it is always wet and sloppy; the
        vegetables, rice, dishes, and nearly every utensil and article of
        food seem to come under this deluge of water.</p><span class=

        167</span></a> (page 186) gives a sketch of an old kitchen Kabutoyama
        in the western part of the province of Musashi. This kitchen is
        nearly three hundred years old, and is the of a kitchen of a wealthy
        and independent Japanese farmer. The great wooden curbed well is seen
        in front, with a pulley above in which the rope runs. Near by is a
        trough from which a bamboo spout leads to some trough in another
        portion of the house. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kamado,</span></em> or cooking-range, is seen to
        the left, an beyond is a room partly closed by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma.</span></em>
        Directly beyon the well two girls may be seen in the act of preparing
        dinner which consists in arranging the dishes on little raised
        lacquer trays, which are to be carried in when dinner is ready. Near
        the range are little portable affairs made of soft stone used as
        braziers. The raised floor is composed of broad planks; kitchens
        invariably have wooden floors, which are oftentimes very smooth and
        polished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usual form of
        kitchen range is represented in <a href="#myfig168" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 168</span></a>; this is
        made of broken tiles and mud or clay compacted together and neatly
        plastered and blackened on the outside. In this range there are two
        recesses for fire, which open directly in front; and this structure
        rests upon a stout wooden frame having a place for ashes in front,
        and a space beneath in which the wood and charcoal are kept.
        Sometimes this range, retaining the same form, is made of copper;
        within this water is kept, and little openings permit the wine-bottle
        to be immersed in order to heat it, as the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sake</span></em> is
        drunk hot without the admixture of hot water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another kitchen
        in a house in Imado, Tokio, a hood of sheet-iron was arranged to
        convey the smoke outside the building. This is probably a modern
        device (<a href="#myfig169" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        "#myfig170" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        170</span></a> a sketch is given of a kitchen in Tokio in which the
        range was a closed affair made of stone, with a funnel at the end as
        in our stoves. I was told by the owner of this house that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span> this kind of a
        stove had been in use in his family for three generations, at least.
        In this kitchen an area level with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page190">[pg 190]</span> ground is seen, in which stands the sink
        containing an invert rice-kettle. Beside the sink stands a huge
        water-jar, with water bucket and water-dipper conveniently near;
        above is a shelf up which are numerous buckets and tubs. On one of
        the posts hangs the usual bamboo rack for skewers, wooden spoons,
        spatulas, etc., and below it is a case for the meat and fish knives.
        On a bamboo pole a few towels hang, and also two large fishes' heads
        from which a thin soup is to be made. On a post near the mouth of the
        stove hangs a coarse wire sieve with which to sift the ashes for the
        little bits of unburnt charcoal, which are always frugally saved, and
        near by is a covered vessel to hold these cinders. The customary
        stone brazier for heating water for the tea stands near the
        stove.</p>

        economical device for the cooking of small messes or for boiling
        water, charcoal being used for the purpose. Instead of bellows, a fan
        is used for kindling or quickening a fire. A short bamboo tube is
        also used through which the cook's lungs act as a bellows in
        performing a like service.</p>

        have the grilling and stewing ostentatiously displayed in the same

        in the north of Japan, and in the country everywhere. Here the
        fireplace is in the centre of the room. A kettle is suspended over
        the fire by a chain, and other kettles are huddled around it to be
        heated. Overhead a rack hangs, from which fish and meat <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span> are suspended, and thus the
        smoke which ascends from the fire is utilized in curing them.
        Sometimes a large cushion of straw is suspended above the smoke, and
        little fish skewered with pointed sticks are thrust into this bunch
        of straw like pins in a pin-cushion.</p>

        175</span></a> a more elaborate affair is shown from which to suspend
        the teakettle. This is a complex mechanism with a curious joint, so
        that it may be hoisted or lowered at will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the hut of the

        into the ashes in one corner. These consist of a long pair of iron
        chop-sticks held together at one end by a large ring, so that one leg
        of the tongs, so to speak, may not get misplaced. No inconsiderable
        skill is required to pick up hot coals with this <span class=

        to mention here an arrangement for holding a pot over the fire, seen
        in a boat coming down the Kitakami River, and which is probably used
        in the north of Japan, though I have never seen it in the house. It
        consisted of an upright stick having a groove through the centre. In
        this groove fitted a jointed stick resting horizontally, and arranged

        rooms, being permanently covered with the mats already described in
        previous chapters, has no special attention bestowed upon it; at all
        events, the floor is often of rough boards laid in such a way that
        irregular spaces occur between them. When the house has a proper hall
        or vestibule, the floor is composed of wide planks; and the smooth,
        ivory-like, polished condition in which such floors are often kept is
        surprising. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span>
        country houses it is not unusual to see polished-wood floors in
        portions of the front rooms, and as one rides along the road he may
        often see the reflection of the garden beyond In their polished
        surfaces. In country inns the floor in the front <span class=

        traders bordering the street the matted floor properly terminates a
        few feet within the sill, the space between being of earth. The floor
        being raised, the space between the edge of the floor and the earth
        is generally filled with plain panels of wood, though sometimes
        designs of flowers or conventional figures are cut in the panel.
        These panels are often arranged so that they can be removed,
        revealing a space under the floor in which shoes, umbrellas, etc.,
        can be stowed away.</p>

        surprising features that strike a foreigner as he becomes acquainted
        with the Japanese house is the entire <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page196">[pg 196]</span> absence of so many things that with us
        clutter the closets, or make squirrel-nests of the attic,‚ÄîI speak now
        of the common house. The reason of this is that the people have never
        developed the miserly spirit of hoarding truck and rubbish with the
        idea that some day it may come into use: this spirit when developed
        is a mania converts a man's attic and shed into a junk shop. The few
        necessary articles kept by the Japanese are stowed away in boxes,
        cupboards, interspaces beneath the floors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The kitchens in
        every case have wood floors, as do the halls, verandahs, and all
        passage-ways. The ground beneath the floor is, in the houses of the
        better class, prepared with gravel and mortar mixed with clay, or
        macadamized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A variety of
        closets is found in the Japanese house. The larger closets, closed by
        sliding screens or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em> are used for clothing and
        bedding. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tansu</span></em>‚Äîa chest of drawers not unlike
        our bureau‚Äîis often placed within the closet, which is also a
        receptacle for chests and trunks. The ordinary high closet is not so
        often seen; and where in our <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page197">[pg 197]</span> houses it is deemed a necessity to have
        each chamber provided with a closet, in the Japanese house
        bed-chambers rarely contain such conveniences. There are low
        cupboards or closets in certain recesses, the upper part or top of
        which forms a deep open shelf. In the kitchen, dressers and similar
        conveniences are used for the dishes. In the province of Omi it is
        common to see a case of shelves with cupboard beneath; upon the
        shelves the larger dishes are displayed. In the kitchen there is
        often combined with the flight of stairs a closet; and this closet
        usually has a door swinging on hinges. In this closet are often kept
        the bed-clothes, pillows, candle-sticks, and night-lamps. <a href=
        "#myfig177" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        177</span></a> illustrates the appearance of this closet. In the
        hallway, also, a closet is sometimes seen in which to stow away the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">geta,</span></em> or wooden clogs. A closet of
        this nature is described farther on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As most of the
        houses are of one story, and the area between the ceiling and the
        roof never utilized, as with us, stairways are not common; when they
        do occur they are primitive in their construction. A stairway
        incorporated into the structure of a building and closed below I have
        never seen in Japan; nor is there any approach to the broad, low
        steps and landings or spiral staircases such as we are familiar with
        in American houses. If the house be of two stories the staircase
        assumes the form of a rather precipitous step-ladder; that is, it has
        two side-pieces, or strings, in which the steps, consisting of thick
        plank, are mortised. This ladder is so steeply inclined that one has
        to step sideways in ascending, otherwise his knee would strike the
        step above. Rarely is there any convenience to hold on by: if
        present, however, this consists of a strip of wood fastened to the
        wall, or a rope is secured in the same way. The front of the step is
        open,‚Äîthat is, there is no riser; but if the back of the steps face
        an open room, then slats of wood are nailed on
        behind.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a beautiful
        house recently erected in one of the imperial gardens is a remarkably
        pure and simple staircase and rail (<a href="#myfig178" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 178</span></a>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the inns and
        large farm-houses the step-ladder form is often seen, and this is
        removable if occasion calls for it. Another kind, common to the same
        class of houses, has the appearance of a number of square boxes piled
        one upon another, like a set of different-sized blocks. This is a
        compact structure, however, though in reality consisting of a number
        compartments which may be separated. There are many forms of this
        kind of staircase. The one shown in fig. 177 has the first two step
        closed; then comes a low cupboard with sliding doors at the side, its
        upper corners forming another step. Upon the cupboard rest three more
        steps, each of which has a drawer which pulls out at the side. Next
        to this comes a high closet, supporting on its top two or three more
        steps. This closet usually has a swinging door,‚Äîa feature rarely seen
        elsewhere within the Japanese house proper. This closet contains on
        its floor the night-lamp, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">andon,</span></em> and tall candlesticks, and
        above are stowed away the bedding and pillows; or it may be used for
        trays and dishes. The steps are not so steep as in the ladder-form,
        have no baluster or rail, and are remarkably solid. It may be well to
        say here that the wood composing the staircase, as well as certain
        floors, is highly finished, often with a surface like polished ivory.
        I have frequently examined the wood for evidences of wax or polish
        applied to its surface, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
        199]</span> but found none. Inquiry brought out the curious
        information that the water from the bath is often used to moisten the
        cloth with which the wood is wiped; and evidently the sebaceous
        secretions of the skin had much to do with the beautiful polish often
        attained. When a house possesses a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genka,</span></em> or
        hall, the steps, two or three in number, are as broad as the hall,
        and generally the steps are somewhat higher than our steps. These
        steps are in every case permanently built into the structure of the
        floor. In the steps which lead from the verandah to the ground the
        usual form is in the shape of square or irregular blocks of stone or
        wood; if of wood, the step may be a transverse section of some huge
        tree, or a massive plank. Other forms of steps may consist simply of
        two side-pieces, with the steps made of plank and mortised in
        (<a href="#myfig179" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 179</span></a>); or a more compact structure may
        be made with a very low hand-rail. These forms are all adjustable;
        that is, they may be placed at any part of the verandah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
        feature of social life in Japan which has been more ignorantly, and
        in some cases wilfully, animadverted upon than the custom of public
        bathing; nevertheless, I dare to say that there is no feature in
        Japanese life to be more heartily commended than this same system of
        public bathing. But by this assertion I do not mean to suggest that
        we shall forthwith proceed to establish baths after the Japanese
        style, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span> take
        them after the Japanese fashion. The Japanese, as well as other
        Eastern people, have for centuries been accustomed to see nakedness,
        without its provoking among them the slightest attention, or in any
        way suggesting immodesty. With us, on the contrary, the effect has
        been different; and the dire result is seen in the almost utter
        extinction in our country of the classical drama, and the
        substitution therefor of ballet-dancing and burlesques,‚Äîof anything
        in fact that shall present to the vulgar gaze of thousands the female
        form in scanty apparel.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
        "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> A
        Turkish woman looks upon her Christian sister as not only immodest
        and vulgar, but absolutely immoral, because she unblushingly parades
        the public street with a naked face; but the Christian woman knows
        that the established customs of her country sanction such an exposure
        as entirely proper. A girl who in our country would deem it immodest
        to appear among the members of her own family in a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">robe de
        chambre,</span></em> and yet under the glare of a bright gas-light,
        in the midst of scores of strangers, appears with low <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corsage,</span></em>
        is committing an act which to a Turkish woman would appear
        inexplicable. To a Japanese, the sight of our dazzling ball-rooms,
        with girls in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">d√©collet√©</span></em> dresses, clasped in the
        arms of their partners and whirling to the sound of exciting music,
        must seem the wildest debauch imaginable; for in Japan the sexes,
        except among the lower classes, never intermingle. No free and happy
        picnics, sleigh-rides, boat-sails, and evening parties among the
        girls and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span> boys
        are known there; no hand-shake, no friendly kiss. If the Japanese
        visitor in this country is a narrow-minded and witless scribbler, he
        will probably startle his friends at home with accounts of the
        grossly immoral character of Christians. Unfamiliar as he is with the
        corner loafer eying every girl that walks by, or with that class
        which throng our walks with the sole purpose of staring at the girls,
        who are there for the purpose of being stared at, what must he think
        of our people when he visits our summer resorts at the seaside and
        sees a young girl‚Äînay, swarms of them‚Äîtripping over the sand under a
        bright sun, bare-legged, clad only in a single wrapper, which when
        wet clings to her form and renders her an object of contemplation to
        a battalion of young men who fringe the beach!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Japan, among
        the lower classes, the sexes bathe together, but with a modesty and
        propriety that are inconceivable to a foreigner until he has
        witnessed it. Though naked, there is no indecent exposure of the
        person. While in the bath they are absorbed in their work, and though
        chatting and laughing seem utterly unmindful of each other. The
        grossest libels have been written about the Japanese in reference to
        their custom of public bathing; and I hazard the statement, without
        fear of contradiction, that an intelligent Japanese, seeing many of
        our customs for the first time, without knowing the conditions under
        which they had grown up, would find infinitely more to condemn as
        immodest, than an intelligent foreigner would find in seeing for the
        first time certain Japanese customs, with the same ignorance at the
        outset as to what such customs implied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If cleanliness is
        next to godliness, then verily the Japanese are a godly race.<a id=
        "noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> The
        simple statement, without qualification, that numbers of Japanese in
        their public baths bathe in the same <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page202">[pg 202]</span> water would seem a filthy habit. Certainly
        if such a statement were really true in regard to our own lower
        classes, it would be a most filthy habit. When it is understood,
        however, that the Japanese working classes‚Äîsuch as the carpenters,
        masons, and others‚Äîoften bathe two or three times a day, and must of
        necessity enter the bath in a state of cleanliness such as our
        workmen rarely if ever attain, the statement loses some of its force.
        When it is further added that these people do not wash in the baths,
        but boil or soak in them for a while, and then upon a platform, with
        an extra bucket of water and a towel, wash and dry themselves, the
        filthy character of this performance assumes quite another aspect. A
        Japanese familiar with his airy and barn-like theatres, his public
        readings under an open tent-like structure, or gatherings in a room
        in which one or all sides may be open to the air even in mid-winter,
        would look upon the usual public gatherings of our people in
        lecture-halls, schoolrooms, and other closed apartments, wherein the
        air often becomes so foul that people faint and struggle to the door
        to get a breath of fresh air,‚Äîa Japanese, I say, would justly look
        upon such practices as filthy to the last degree. And what <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would</span></em> he
        say to one of our great political meetings, for example, where a vast
        unwashed herd of perspiring and excited people actually bathe their
        delicate membranous lungs in the combined breath of hundreds!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The public baths,
        however, do not concern us,‚Äîthough it may be well to contrast our
        country with Japan in this respect, where in the latter country every
        village and every town, and in the city nearly every square, possess
        public baths where for the price of a cent or two one may find
        conveniences for a hot bath; while in our country public baths are
        only found in the larger cities, and few of these even can boast of
        such a luxury. As for the private houses in our country where bathing
        is customary, an inquiry shows that few possess the convenience of a
        bath-tub.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the masses
        of our people a Saturday-night wash may or may not be enforced; when
        it is, this performance usually takes place in the kitchen, with hot
        water furnished from the kettle. But in Japan nearly every house
        among the higher and middle classes possesses the most ample
        arrangements for hot baths; and even among the poorer classes, in the
        country as well as in the city, this convenience is not wanting, with
        the added convenience of public baths everywhere attainable if
        desired.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        forms of bathing-tubs, all of them being large and deep. Means for
        applying the heat direct, which is of course the most economical, is
        attained in various ways. In the common form (<a href="#myfig180"
        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 180</span></a>), a
        small chamber of copper is introduced at one end near the bottom of
        the tub,‚Äîthe mouth having a frame of stone, or of clay or plaster. In
        this chamber a fire is built, and the water can be brought, if
        necessary, to the boiling-point. Within the tub a few transverse bars
        prevent the bather from coming in contact with the hot chamber in
        which the fire is burning. In another form a copper funnel or tube
        passes directly through the bottom of the bathing-tub (<a href=
        "#myfig181" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        181</span></a>). The bottom of this tube has a grating of wire;
        charcoal is then placed in the tube, and its combustion rapidly heats
        the water. A pan is placed below <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page204">[pg 204]</span> the tube to catch the coal and ashes that
        fall through. In a more elaborate form (<a href="#myfig182" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 182</span></a>), the
        bath-tub is in two sections, separated by the partition of the room.
        These two sections are connected by a number of bamboo tubes or
        flues, so that the water may circulate freely. The section outside
        contains the fire-box, in which the fire is built; by this
        arrangement the bather escapes the discomfort of the smoke from the
        fire.</p>

        form of bathing-tub is shown in <a href="#myfig183" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 183</span></a>, in
        which, outside the tub, is a chamber not unlike a small wooden barrel
        closed at both ends; through this barrel runs a copper tube, in which
        a fire of charcoal is built. The barrel is connected with the
        bath-tub by a large bamboo tube, having a little square door within,
        which the bather may close if the water becomes too hot. In many
        cases a hood is arranged in such a way that the smoke from the fire
        is carried off. These tubs stand on a large wooden floor, the planks
        of which incline to a central gutter. Here the bather scrubs himself
        with a separate bucket of water, after having literally parboiled
        himself in water the temperature <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span> of which is so great that it is impossible
        for a foreigner to endure it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very common form
        of bath in the country consists of a large and shallow iron kettle,
        upon the top of which is secured a wooden extension, so as to give
        sufficient depth to the water within (<a href="#myfig184" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 184</span></a>). The
        fire is built beneath the kettle,‚Äîthe bather having a rack of wood
        which he sinks beneath him, and upon which he stands to protect his
        feet from burning. This tub is called a <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
        doubtless other forms of bath-tubs with conveniences for heating the
        water, but the forms here given comprise the principal kinds. There
        is no reason why similar conveniences might not be adopted in our
        country in cases where aqueducts or city supply is not available.
        There are many forms of foot-tubs and large wooden tubs with high
        backs, in which hot water is poured; but there is no necessity of
        describing them here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While in a
        Japanese house, as we have seen, the most ample conveniences exist
        for taking a hot or cold bath, the minor conveniences for washing the
        face and hands are not always so apparent. In such attempts one is
        more often reminded of a primitive country house at home, where one
        either goes down to the kitchen, and amid a clutter of pails and pans
        manages to wash himself, or else takes a tin basin and goes out to
        the well,‚Äîand this on a fresh cool morning is by far the more
        agreeable. In the country a Japanese may be seen in the yard or by
        the roadside washing his face in a bucket or shallow <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span> tub; and at inns, and even
        in private houses, one is given a copper basin, and a bucket of water
        being brought he uses a portion of the verandah as a wash-stand. That
        conveniences for this purpose do exist to some extent may be seen
        from the accompanying sketches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The one shown in
        <a href="#myfig185" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 185</span></a> may sometimes be found in country
        inns at the north. This consists of a shallow trough resting on the
        floor at the end of the verandah or passage-way. In the trough is a
        stout water-bucket with cover, and a copper wash-basin.</p>

        shown in <a href="#myfig186" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        Here the trough was above the level of the floor, in a recessed
        portion of a passage-way which ran behind a suite of rooms. The
        wood-work about it was made with great care. The sliding
        window-frames, covered with stout white paper, admitted sufficient
        light; while the rich brown pottery-jar, the clean wooden dipper,
        copper basin, and quaint towel-rack were all attractive features from
        their very neatness and simplicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may seem odd
        for one to get enthusiastic over so simple an affair as a trough and
        a few honest contrivances for washing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page207">[pg 207]</span> the hands and face; nevertheless such a
        plain and sensible arrangement is a relief, in contrast to certain
        guest-chambers at home, where one wishing to go through the rather
        vigorous performance of dashing into the water with his elbows
        outstretched, finds these free movements curtailed to the last degree
        by a regiment of senseless toilet articles in the shape of attenuated
        bottles, mugs, soap-dishes with rattling covers, and diminutive
        top-heavy pitchers crowded about his wash-basin, and all resting on a
        slab of white marble. Things are inevitably broken if they are
        brought down too hard upon such a bottom. After such recollections,
        one admires the Japanese sink, with its durable flat-bottomed basin,
        capacious pottery-jar for water, and ample space to thrash about in
        without fear of spattering the wall-paper or smashing a lot of
        useless toilet articles in the act.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The form last
        described is the usual one seen in private houses. Conveniences of
        this nature that are brought to the level of the floor, while giving
        the Japanese who are used to them no trouble, are found to be
        exceedingly awkward for a foreigner, who is obliged to go through his
        toilet in a stooping posture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often the toilet
        places are rendered exceedingly attractive by the ornamental
        wood-work used in their construction.</p>

        This was placed at the end of the verandah, and on a level with the
        floor. A low partition formed a screen at one side; within the recess
        thus made was a low shelf for the pottery water-jar. The floor of the
        sink consisted of bamboo rods placed close together, through which
        the spilled water found its way by proper channels to the ground
        without. A paper-lantern hung against the wall, and dipper and
        towel-rack were conveniently at hand. Other forms might be given, but
        enough has been shown to illustrate how well these conveniences are
        arranged for that important daily operation of washing the face and
        hands. Further conveniences for simply washing the hands are

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The towel-rack
        merits some attention from its exceedingly simple structure. There
        are many forms, most of them rustic in design and made to be
        suspended. The following figures (figs. 188-192) illustrate some of
        the forms in common use. The simplest kind is in the shape of a ring
        of bamboo suspended by a larger bamboo, to the end of which it is
        attached. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span>
        Another form, and a very common one, is a yoke of bamboo, the lower
        ends of which are firmly secured to a larger bamboo, confining at the
        same time a piece of bamboo which slides freely up and down on the
        yoke, and by its own weight resting on the towel which may be thrown
        across the lower bamboo. Another form consists of a loop of bamboo
        suspended to the side of a board which is hung against the wall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The towels are
        pretty objects, being of cotton or linen, and usually have printed
        upon them sketchy designs in two shades of blue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After living in
        Japan for a time one realizes how few are the essentials necessary
        for personal comfort. He further realizes that his personal comfort
        is enhanced by the absence of many things deemed indispensable at
        home. In regard to the bed and its arrangements, the Japanese have
        reduced this affair to its simplest expression. The whole floor, the
        whole house indeed, is a bed, and one can fling himself down on the
        soft mats, in the draught or out of it, upstairs or down, and find a
        smooth, firm, and level surface upon which to sleep,‚Äîno creaking
        springs, hard bunches or awkward hollows awaiting him, but a
        bed-surface as wide as the room itself, and comfortable to the last
        degree. To be more explicit, the bed is made upon the mats; there is
        no bedstead, or frame, or circumscribed area of any kind upon or
        within which the bed is placed.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18"
        href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> The
        bed-clothes consisting of lightly or heavily wadded comforters are
        spread upon the floor, one or more forming the bed, and another one
        acting as a covering. The common ones are wadded with cotton; the
        best ones are made of silk, and are stuffed with floss silk. In
        private houses one often gets a bed consisting of a number of these
        silk comforters,‚Äîand a most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
        211]</span> delightful bed they make. In summer the foreigner finds
        these wadded affairs altogether too hot and stuffy; and at all times
        he misses the clean sheets which at home intervene between the
        bed-clothes and his person,‚Äîthough a clean night-dress is provided if
        desired, and this answers as a substitute for the sheets. In the
        day-time these comforters are folded up and stowed away in some
        closet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usual form of
        pillow, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">makura,</span></em> consists of a light closed
        wooden box, with a bottom either flat or slightly convex. On the top
        of this box is secured a small cylindrically-shaped cushion stuffed
        with buckwheat hulls. This cushion is tied to the box, and the same
        string that holds it in place also secures the pillow-case, which is
        simply a sheet of soft paper folded several times, as shown in the
        figures here given (<a href="#myfig193" class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        other forms of pillow, either in the shape of a hard cushion or of a
        square oblong box, the ends being of wood, and the rest of
        basket-work. Porcelain pillows are also seen, but rarely. There are
        also many forms of portable ones, some of which fold and stow away in
        small compass, and others of which are in the shape of a box, within
        which are drawers and spaces for paper-lantern, matches, mirror,
        comb, and various articles of the toilet. These are generally used by
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span> travellers. The
        Japanese, with a pillow of this kind, can literally take up his bed
        and walk; for if he has a head-rest or pillow containing these
        conveniences, he can get along very well. Pillows in all cases are
        arranged to support the head naturally, when the shoulder rests on
        the floor, as in the following figure (<a href="#myfig194" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 194</span></a>). To a
        foreigner, until he becomes accustomed to it, the Japanese pillow
        seems exceedingly awkward, and his first experience with it results
        in a stiff neck the next morning; and at intervals during the night
        he has the sensation that he is falling out of bed, for any freedom
        of movement of the head results in its downfall from the pillow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Getting used to
        it, however, one recognizes that this pillow has its good points; the
        neck is kept free for the air to circulate beneath, and the head is
        kept cool. This peculiar form of pillow was a necessity for the
        Japanese so long as the hair was done up in the rigid <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">queue,</span></em>
        and is still a necessity for women with their methods of
        hair-dressing; but with the general abandonment of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">queue</span></em> on
        the part of the men, a few of them are resorting to head-rests more
        like our pillows, though much smaller and harder, and on the whole I
        believe many find this substitute more comfortable.</p>

        of bed entails much less work on the chamber-maid than do our
        arrangements. In a large inn one girl will do the chamber-work for
        the entire house. In fact this work is ridiculously simple. The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        folded up and stowed away, or hung over the balcony rail to air. She
        gathers up a huge pile of the light pillow-boxes <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span> in her arms, and carries
        them to the room below; here she unties the strings which hold the
        cushions in place, substitutes clean sheets of folded paper for the
        soiled ones,‚Äîand the work of bed-making is done. With a duster,
        consisting of strips of tough paper tied to the end of a slender
        bamboo, the rooms are dusted and made ready for the next arrivals. As
        matters pertaining to the toilet are performed in other portions of
        the house, the rooms are placed in order in an incredibly short
        time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a crowded inn
        each guest may occupy the dimensions of one mat; and the entire floor
        is occupied in this way. In winter a thickly-wadded comforter is
        provided, which is made in the form of a huge garment having
        capacious sleeves. Many rooms have a square hole in the floor in
        which, when needed, a fire of charcoal may be kindled; this is called
        a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ro.</span></em> Above the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ro</span></em> a
        square frame of wood is adjusted, and the bed-clothes being placed
        over this frame are thoroughly heated, so that one may go to bed in
        the warmest of nests. In the day-time one may gather a portion of the
        bed-clothes about him, and keep warm by the little coal-fire burning
        beneath. <a href="#myfig195" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 195</span></a> is an illustration of this opening
        in the floor, with frame-work above to keep the bedclothes from
        falling on the fire below. A little wooden box is used for the
        purpose of holding an earthen receptacle for coals, and this is taken
        to bed as a substitute for the hot stone or brick which is often used
        at home for a similar purpose. From the inflammable nature of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span> the bedding,
        many fires must originate from carelessness in the use of this
        luxury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this connection
        it may be well to add that oftentimes little square thin cushions are
        provided for guests to sit upon; and one often sees a light round
        cushion which is used as elbow-rest when one is reclining (<a href=
        "#myfig196" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        196</span></a>).</p>

        or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kaya,</span></em> are to be found in all houses,
        even the poorest people being supplied with them. The usual form of
        netting is made in the shape of a square box, nearly as large as the
        room, and this, when placed in position, is suspended at the four
        corners by cords which are tied to pegs in the four corners of the
        room. A smaller netting for infants is made on a frame work of bamboo
        like a cage, and this may be placed over the infant wherever it may
        drop to sleep on the mats.</p>

        cleats are nailed on opposite sides to answer as handles; or, as is

        customary to heap the ashes in a pyramidal pile about the coals and
        mark a series of radiating lines upon it. The charcoal to replenish
        the fire is generally kept in a basket, though sometimes a deep
        wooden box with a handle is used. The baskets used for this purpose
        are always tasty affairs, having often a rich brown color from age.
        In the basket is a pair of old brass or copper rods with which to
        handle the coal. A single stick of coal buried vertically in the
        ashes is burned for several hours. The charcoal-vender has a curious
        way of utilizing the small and pulverized fragments of the charcoal,
        by mixing the powder with some kind of sea-weed, and then forming the
        mass into round balls the size of a large orange. In making these
        balls he goes through a motion precisely like that seen in making
        snow-balls. These are afterwards dried in the sun, and seem to burn
        very well. In riding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before kerosene
        oil was introduced into Japan the means of illumination were of the
        most meagre description. One can hardly realize the difficulty a
        student must have experienced in studying his Chinese Classics by the
        feeble light emitted from tiny wicks, or the dim and unsteady flame
        of a vegetable-wax candle,‚Äîa light rendered all the more feeble when
        filtered through a paper lantern. It is related that in former times
        devout students of the Chinese Classics were accustomed at night to
        read a single character at a time by the dim illumination of a
        glowing coal at the end of an incense-stick held close to the page!
        Of the many things which the Japanese have adopted and promptly
        utilized from Western nations, I know of nothing which has been so
        great a boon to all the people as kerosene oil. The Western practice
        of medicine is rapidly displacing the empirical Chinese practice, and
        this when accomplished will be, beyond all question, the greatest
        boon. There are many outlying districts, however, as well as
        thousands of inhabitants of the cities, still under the sway of
        Chinese methods, and the beneficent effects of the rational treatment
        of disease has not yet been widely felt; but everywhere throughout
        the Empire the bright light of kerosene has lengthened the day for
        all.</p>

        wick projects in a firm, hard point. When a candle has burned low, it
        is removed from the candlestick and placed on the end of the new
        candle, which is then adjusted on the sharp spur. By this simple
        device all the candle is utilized in combustion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A superior kind of
        candle, made in the province of Aidsu, is beautifully painted in
        bright colors, with designs of flowers and other ornamental
        subjects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Candles are
        depended upon to illuminate the rooms, as well as to light the
        hand-lanterns which are carried about the streets, and those which
        are used for the house,‚Äîthese last consisting of a square or
        hexagonal frame, covered with paper and attached to the end of a
        short handle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A common form of
        Japanese candlestick, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">te-shoku,</span></em> is represented in <a href=
        "#myfig205" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        205</span></a>. It is a rude affair made of iron, supported on three
        legs, and has a wide disk to prevent the melted wax from dropping on
        the mats, and a ring about the candle to prevent its falling over. It
        is easily picked up from the floor by its longer arm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another common
        form of candlestick consists of a hemispherical base of brass, ten or
        fifteen inches in diameter, from which a rod of the same metal runs
        up to the height of two feet or more, on the end of which is the
        usual cup and spur. Candlesticks of this description are seen in
        <a href="#myfig177" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 177</span></a> (page 196).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The snuffer is
        usually in the form of a blunt pair of tweezers, with which the burnt
        wick is removed; the servants, however, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page221">[pg 221]</span> often take the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hibashi,</span></em>
        or tongs, and, removing the wick, thrust it into the ashes of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Candlesticks of
        rustic design, manufactured of curious woods, are made at Nikko and
        other famous resorts, more as mementos to carry away than as
        implements intended for actual use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese lamp
        is usually in the form of a shallow saucer, in which vegetable oil is
        burned. The wick, consisting of long slender rods of pith, is held
        down by a little ring of iron, to which a spur is attached for a
        handle. The unburned portion of the wick projects beyond the saucer,
        and as it burns away at one end is moved along. The saucer rests in a
        disk or ring of iron, which is suspended within a frame covered with
        paper. A common form of this lamp, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">andon,</span></em> is
        shown in <a href="#myfig206" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 206</span></a>. It consists of a square frame of
        wood covered with paper, open above and below, and having one side
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span> in the shape of
        a movable lid, which can be raised when the lamp needs tending. This
        frame is secured to two uprights, which spring from a wooden stand in
        which may be a drawer containing extra wicks and a pair of snuffers.
        These uprights extend above the lantern, and have a cross-piece by
        which the lantern is lifted, and another cross-bar just below from
        which the lamp hangs. The light from this night-lamp is feeble and
        uncertain, and by it one can barely see his way about the room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        kinds of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">andon,</span></em> some being very ingenious.
        One form is cylindrical, being composed of two frames, one within the
        other,‚Äîthe outer frame revolving in a groove in the stand. One half
        of each lantern is covered with paper, so that by turning the outer
        frame the openings are brought together, and thus access is gained to
        the lamp. Another form of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">andon</span></em>(<a href="#myfig207" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 207</span></a>) opens in

        of oil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still another form
        (<a href="#myfig208" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 208</span></a>) is copied from an old colored
        picture-book; this consists of an elaborate lacquered stand mounted
        in metal, with a lamp supported on the top.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        passage-ways, and at the head of stairways, lamps are often fixed to
        the wall. In Osaka I saw a curious one, which is represented in
        <a href="#myfig209" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 209</span></a>. The frame was hung by hinges to a
        board which was affixed to the wall (the hinges <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span> being above), and rested
        against the board like a cover, and was lifted up when the lamp
        needed attention. In an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        iron-work (<a href="#myfig210" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        pottery are rarely seen. <a href="#myfig211" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 211</span></a> is a
        sketch of an old lamp of Oribe ware from the author's collection. An
        inclined portion within supports the wick, and the cover is notched
        in front and behind to allow the passage of the wick. Another form
        from the same collection, made in the province of Iga, is shown in
        <a href="#myfig212" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 212</span></a>. In this lamp the wick must have
        been made from some fibre; a hole in the wick-tube is seen through
        which the wick can be moved along. The handle of the lamp has a slot
        in it, so that it may be hung against the wall. It is possible that
        these two lamps, or at least the last one, are for the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kami-dana</span></em>, a shelf which supports
        the household shrine. In connection with lamps made of pottery, it
        may be well to add that now and then one meets with a pottery
        candlestick. That shown in <a href="#myfig213" class=

        generally a quaint old rusty affair suspended by a chain, and, when
        lighted, admitting through the perforations in its side the faintest
        possible glimmer. In figs. 240 and 253 (pages 255 and 267) lanterns

        <a href="#myfig214" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        height, and seems to be a frail affair to expose on a public street.
        The very frailty and lightness of such objects, however, often
        exposed as they are with entire safety on busy thoroughfares, are
        striking indications of the gentle manners of the Japanese. One is
        led to wonder how long such a delicate street-lamp would remain
        intact in our streets, with those mobs thronging by that seem to be
        solely a product of our civilization. These, and a thousand similar
        points of contrast, set a thoughtful man reflecting on the manners
        and customs of the two great civilizations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In nearly every
        house one sees perched up on a shelf called the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kami-dana</span></em>
        a curious little architectural affair, which on more special
        examination proves to be a model of a Shin-t≈ç shrine, or a principal
        feature of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span>
        Shin-t≈ç altar,‚Äîa circular mirror. On the shelf in front of this are a
        few lamps (or a single lamp) and trays, containing at times
        food-offerings. If the shrine is in the shape of a box, then
        accompanying it are various little brass stands, slips of wood with
        characters written upon them, and in short a miniature
        representation, apparently, of the paraphernalia used in a large
        temple. The shelf is high up on the wall near the ceiling; and in old
        houses this region is black with the accumulations of smoke from the
        little lamp which is lighted every night, and which may have burned
        there for a century. These are the Shin-t≈ç shrines.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Buddhist
        household shrines, having a figure of Buddha or of one of his
        disciples, or perhaps of some other god, are much more ornate, and
        rest on the floor,‚Äîat least so I was informed. My informant also told
        me that the majority of the people worship at the shrines of both
        great beliefs, and that all Buddhists, unless very strict, have
        Shint≈ç shrines in their houses. Indeed, Buddhists and even Buddhist
        priests have been known to go into the Roman Catholic cathedral at
        Osaka, and bow in reverence before the altar and other emblems of an
        alien religion. The tolerance and charity evinced in such acts is
        something pathetic, when one recalls the mutually hostile attitude of
        the two great branches of the Christian Church!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Flowers and
        incense-burning usually accompany the Buddhist household shrine,
        while before Shin-t≈ç shrines incense is not burned. Buddhist shrines
        have placed before them lamps of brass, or hanging lamps, while in
        front of the Shin-t≈ç shrine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
        226]</span> candles of vegetable wax are burned. In unglazed,
        hand-made pottery called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kawarake</span></em> oil is burned, which is
        also used for food-offerings. For offerings of wine, oval bottles of
        peculiar shape, with long narrow necks, are used; these are called
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">miki-dokkuri,</span></em>‚Äî<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">miki</span></em>
        being the name of the wine offered to the gods, and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokkuri</span></em>
        the name of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sake</span></em> bottle. In front of these
        shrines one may often see the inmates of the house bow their heads,
        clap their hands, and then, rubbing the palms together in an
        imploring gesture, pray with much earnestness. So far as I have
        observed, every house has this domestic altar. In shops, too, one
        often sees the shrine; and in the larger and more wealthy shops the
        shrine is often a very expensive affair. In a famous silk-shop in
        Tokio is a large model of a Shin-t≈ç temple suspended by iron rods
        from the beams above. In front of it hang two big metal lanterns. It
        struck me that this display of piety was rather ostentatious, and
        paralleled similar displays sometimes seen at home; in this
        supposition, however, I may be doing an injustice. Among the
        intelligent classes the household shrine seems to be provided for the
        female members of the family only, the men having outgrown these
        superstitions; and it was interesting to observe that in Japan, as
        elsewhere, the women‚Äîbeing as a rule less informed‚Äîmade up the
        majority of those attending public worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sketch here
        given of a Buddhist household shrine (<a href="#myfig215" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 215</span></a>) was seen
        in a house of the most squalid character. The various vessels were
        filled with boiled rice, with loaves of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mochi</span></em>
        made of a special kind of rice, and a number of unripe peaches.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span> On the lower
        shelf, in the right-hand corner, are seen a sweet potato and a radish
        propped up on four legs, looking like toy deer or beasts of some
        kind. Whether this indicated the work of children or represented the
        horses upon which the gods could take a ride, was not
        ascertained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A household shrine
        to which the children pay voluntary and natural devotion are the
        birds' nests built within the house. It is a common thing, not only
        in the country but in large cities like Tokio, for a species of
        swallow, hardly to be distinguished from the European species, to
        build its nest in the house,‚Äînot in an out-of-the-way place, but in
        the room where the family may be most actively engaged, or in the
        shop fronting the street, with all its busy traffic going on. The
        very common occurrence of these birds' nests in houses is another of
        the many evidences of the gentle ways of this people, and of the
        kindness shown by them to animals.</p>

        its nest in the house, a little shelf is promptly secured beneath it,
        so that the mats below shall not be soiled. The presence of the bird
        in the house is regarded as a good omen, and the children take great
        pleasure in watching the construction of the nest and the final
        rearing of the young birds. I noticed that many of the nests built
        within the house were much more elaborately made than those built in
        more exposed positions. From the symmetrical way in which many of
        these were constructed, one might almost imagine the birds had become
        imbued with some of the art instincts of the <span class="tei tei-pb"

        affectation of false delicacy were no allusion to be made to the
        privy, which in the Japanese house often receives a share of the
        artistic workman's attention. From its position in the house, and
        especially in the public house, it is often a source of great
        discomfort. In the better class of private houses in Japan, however,
        there are less annoyance and infinitely less danger from this source
        than are experienced in many houses of the wealthy in our great
        cities. In the country the privy is usually a little box-like affair
        removed from the house, the entrance closed half way up by a swinging
        door. In the city house of the better class it is at one corner of
        the house, usually at the end of the verandah, and sometimes there
        are two at diagonal corners, as a reference to the plans will show. A
        curious superstition among many is attached to the position of the
        privy in its relation to the house,‚Äîa trace possibly of the Chinese
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Fung-shui.</span></em> The privy generally has
        two compartments,‚Äîthe first one having a wooden or porcelain urinal;
        the latter form being called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">asagaowa,</span></em> as it is supposed, to
        resemble the flower of the morning glory,‚Äîthe word literally meaning

        class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 219</span></a>).
        The wooden ones are often filled with branches of spruce, which are
        frequently replenished. The inner <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page229">[pg 229]</span> compartment has a rectangular opening cut
        in the floor, and in the better class of privies this is provided
        with a cover having a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
        230]</span> long wooden handle. The wood-work about this opening is
        sometimes lacquered. Straw sandals or wooden clogs are often provided
        to be worn in this place.</p>

        illustrates the appearance of one in an inn at Hachi-ishi, near
        Nikko. The planking in the front of the sketch shows the verandah;
        from this, at right angles, runs a narrow platform, having for its
        border the natural trunk of a tree; the corner of a little cupboard
        is seen at the left; the ceiling is composed of matting made of thin
        strips of wood, and below is a dado of bamboo. The opening to the
        first apartment is framed by a twisted grape-vine, while other sticks
        in their natural condition make up the frame-work. Beyond the arched
        opening is another one closed by a swinging door; and this is usually
        the only place in the house where one finds a hinged door, except,
        perhaps, on the tall closet under the kitchen stairs. The roof is
        covered thickly with the diminutive shingles already alluded to.
        Outside a little screen fence is built, a few plants neatly trained
        below,‚Äîand <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span> a

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The receptacle in
        the privy consists of a half of an oil barrel, or a large earthen
        vessel, sunk in the ground, with convenient access to it from the
        outside. This is emptied every few days by men who have their regular
        routes; and as an illustration of the value of this material for
        agricultural <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span>
        purposes, I was told that in Hiroshima in the renting of the poorer
        tenement houses, if three persons occupied a room together the sewage
        paid the rent of one, and if five occupied the same room no rent was
        charged! Indeed, the immense value and importance of this material is
        so great to the Japanese farmer, who depends entirely upon it for the
        enrichment of his soil, that in the country personal conveniences for
        travellers are always arranged by the side of the road, in shape of
        buckets or half-barrels sunk in the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judging by our
        standards of modesty in regard to these matters there would appear to
        be no evidence of delicacy among the Japanese respecting them; or, to
        be more just, perhaps should say that there is among them no
        affectation of false modesty,‚Äîa feeling which seems to have developed
        among the English-speaking people more exclusively, and among some of
        them to such ridiculous heights of absurdity as often to be fraught
        with grave consequences. But among the Japanese it would seem as if
        the publicity given by them to the collecting of this important
        fertilizer had dulled all sensitiveness on their part, if it ever
        existed, concerning this matter.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19"
        href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> Indeed,
        privacy in this matter would be impossible when it is considered that
        in cities‚Äîas in Tokio, for example‚Äîof nearly a million of inhabitants
        this material is carried off daily to the farms outside, the vessels
        in which it is conveyed being long cylindrical buckets borne by men
        and horses. If sensitive persons are offended by these conditions,
        they must admit that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span> the secret of sewage disposal has been effectually solved
        by the Japanese for centuries, so that nothing goes to waste. And of
        equal importance, too, is it that of that class of diseases which
        scourge our communities as a result of our ineffectual efforts in
        disposing of sewage, the Japanese happily know but little. In that
        country there are no deep vaults with long accumulations
        contaminating the ground, or underground pipes conducting sewage to
        shallow bays and inlets, there to fester and vitiate the air and
        spread sickness and death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand
        it must be admitted that their water supply is very seriously
        affected by this sewage being washed into rivers and wells from the
        rice-fields where it is deposited; and the scourge of cholera, which
        almost yearly spreads its desolating shadow over many of their
        southern towns, is due to the almost universal cultivation of the
        land by irrigation methods; and the consequent distribution of sewage
        through these surface avenues renders it impossible to protect the
        water supply from contamination.</p>

        APPROACHES.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The study of the
        house-architecture of Japan, as compared with that of America, it is
        curious to observe the relative degree of importance given to similar
        features by the two peoples. With us the commonest house in the city
        or country will have a definite front-door, and almost always one
        with some embellishments, in the shape of heavy panels, ornate
        brackets and braces supporting some sort of a covering above, and
        steps approaching it equally pretentious; in the ordinary Japanese
        house, on the contrary, this entrance is, as we shall see, often,
        though not always, of the most indefinite character. With us, again,
        the hall or front-entry stairs may be seen immediately on entering
        the house,‚Äîand this portion has some display in the baluster and
        gracefully curving rail, and in the better class of houses receives
        special attention from the architect; in Japan, however, if the house
        be of two stories the stairway is never in sight, and is rarely more
        than a stout and precipitous step-ladder. On the other hand, the
        ridge of the roof, which in Japan almost invariably forms the most
        picturesque feature of the house exterior, is with us nothing more
        than the line of junction of the plainest rain-shed; though in great
        edifices feeble attempts have been made to decorate this lofty and
        conspicuous line by an inverted cast-iron design, which is not only
        absolutely useless as a structural feature, but, so far as the design
        is concerned, might be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
        235]</span> equally appropriate for the edge of a tawdry valentine or
        the ornamental fringe which comes in a Malaga raisin-box.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accustomed as we
        are, then, to a front-door with steps and rail and a certain
        pretentious architectural display, it is difficult to conceive of a
        house without some such distinctive characters to its portal. In the
        ordinary Japanese house, however, we often look in vain for such
        indications. In the common class of their houses, and even in those
        of more importance, the entrance is often vaguely defined; one may
        enter the house by way of the garden and make his salutations on the
        verandah, or he may pass into the house by an ill-defined boundary
        near the kitchen,‚Äîa sort of back-door on the front side. In other
        houses this entrance is by means of a small matted area, which
        differs in no respect from the other rooms save that the outer edge
        of its raised floor is some distance within the eaves, and between
        this and the sill the floor is mother earth. One or two steps,
        consisting of single planks running the width of the room, lead from
        the earth to the floor. The roof at this point may be a gable, as
        more specially marking the entrance. These indefinite entrances,
        however, belong only to the houses of what may be called the middle
        and lower classes, though even in houses of the middle classes
        well-marked entrances, and even entrances of some pretensions, are
        not uncommon. Some may be inclined to doubt the statement that in the
        ordinary houses the entrance is often more or less vaguely defined.
        As a curious proof of this, however, I have in my possession Japanese
        architects' plans of two houses, consisting of a number of rooms, and
        representing dwellings far above the ordinary type; and though I have
        consulted a number of Japanese friends in regard to these plans, none
        of them have been able to tell me where the main entrance is, or
        ought to be!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a better class
        of houses the entrance is in the form of a wide projecting porch,
        with special gable roof, having <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page236">[pg 236]</span> elaborately carved wood-work about its
        front, the opening being as wide as the porch itself. The floor
        consists of wide planks running at right angles with the sill, which
        is grooved to accommodate the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado,</span></em> or storm-doors. From this
        floor one reaches the floor beyond by means of one or two steps,‚Äîthe
        edge of the floor near the steps being grooved to accommodate the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji.</span></em> The back partition of this
        hall is a permanent one. On either side sliding screens lead to the
        rooms within. A dado of wood runs about the sides of the vestibule,
        while the wall above is plastered. A low screen, called a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tsui-tate,</span></em> is usually the sole
        ornament of the hall; and in olden times there hung on the wall
        behind the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tsui-tate</span></em> curious long-handled
        weapons, which now are seen only as museum specimens. This screen has
        no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span> folds; the
        frame is thick and lacquered, and the transverse feet are ponderous
        and also lacquered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would seem as
        if the fitting architecture of this important portal had been
        transferred to the gateway,‚Äîponderous hinged-doors, bolts, bars, and
        all; for in the gateways a conspicuous, though oftentimes fictitious,
        solidity is shown in the canopy of beams and tiles, supported by
        equally massive posts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In <a href=
        "#myfig221" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        221</span></a> is shown a view of the entrance to the house figured
        on pages 54 and 55. It is the house of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">samurai,</span></em>
        and is a fair example of the entrance to the house of a gentleman in
        ordinary circumstances. On the left of the entrance is a plastered
        partition separating the hall from the kitchen. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span> On the right is a small
        room separated from the vestibule by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em>
        not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma.</span></em> This may be considered a
        waiting-room, where parties on business are shown; a servant usually
        waits here to attend callers. Directly beyond, one enters a suite of
        rooms which border the garden at the back of the house. At the
        immediate entrance is a sill; over this sill one steps upon the earth
        floor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sill is
        grooved to accommodate the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado,</span></em> which are put in place when
        the house is closed for the night. When a house has a definite
        entrance like this, there are usually conveniences for stowing away
        travelling gear,‚Äîsuch as umbrellas, lanterns, and wooden clogs. For
        example, in ordinary houses, for the sake of economy in space, a
        portion of the raised floor of the vestibule consists of movable
        planks, which may be lifted up, revealing a space beneath
        sufficiently ample to accommodate these articles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plan here
        given (<a href="#myfig222" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 222</span></a>) shows a hall often seen in the
        better class of houses. The area between the entrance and the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> projects as a porch from the
        side of the house, the three-matted area coming within the house
        proper. The lettering on the plan clearly explains the various
        parts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a narrow hall
        in an old house near Uyeno, in Tokio, I got the accompanying sketch
        of a shoe-closet (<a href="#myfig223" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 223</span></a>). The
        briefest examination of the various clogs it contained revealed the
        same idiosyncrasies of walking as with us,‚Äîsome were down at the
        heel, others were worn at the sides. There were clogs of many sizes
        and kinds,‚Äîcommon clogs of the school-children, with the dried mud of
        the street still clinging to them, and the best clogs with lacquered
        sides and finely-matted soles. At one side hung a set of shoe-cords
        ready for emergency.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another house,

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em> designed for holding the
        family lanterns (<a href="#myfig224" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=

        fact which is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span>
        probably well known to most of our readers,‚Äîthat the Japanese almost
        invariably carry lighted lanterns when they walk out at night. Upon
        the outside of these lanterns is painted the crest, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mon,</span></em> of
        the family, or the name of the house: a man with an eye to business
        may advertise it on his lantern by some quaint design. So persistent
        is this habit of carrying lanterns, that on bright moonlight nights
        the lantern is brought into requisition; and nothing strikes a
        foreigner as so ludicrous as the sight of a number of firemen on the
        top of a burning building, holding lighted lanterns in their hands!
        The lanterns fold up into a small compass; and on the lantern-shelf
        which we have shown were a number of thick pasteboard boxes in which
        were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span> stowed
        away the lanterns. On each box was painted a design corresponding to
        the design of the lantern within. In this case the name of the
        family, or the crest, was indicated.</p>

        stoutly but neatly barred,‚Äîand permanently too, a portion of it being

        distance from the ground, and one on entering steps over this sill to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The verandah is an
        essential part of the Japanese house. The word itself is of Oriental
        origin, and it is difficult to imagine an Oriental house of any
        pretensions without a verandah of some kind. In the Japanese house it
        is almost a continuation of the floor of the room, being but slightly
        below its level. The verandah is something more than a luxury; it is
        a necessity arising from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page242">[pg 242]</span> peculiar construction of the house. The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em> with their delicate frames
        and white paper-coverings, which take the place of our glass windows
        in admitting light to the room, are from their very nature easily
        injured by the rain; the edge of the room; therefore, where these
        run, must come a few feet within the eaves; of the roof, or of any
        additional rain-shed which may be built above the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sh≈çji.</span></em> At
        this line, therefore, the matted floor ceases, and a plank floor of
        varying width continues beyond, upon the outer edge of which is a
        single groove to accommodate another set of screens made of wood.
        These are called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado,</span></em> literally <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúrain-door,‚Äù</span> and at night and during driving
        storms they are closed. At times, however, the rain may beat in
        between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado;</span></em> but though wetting the
        verandah, it rarely reaches the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ordinary houses
        the verandah has no outer rail, though in the houses of the nobility
        a rail is often present. The width of the verandah varies in
        proportion to the size of the house. In some of the temples the
        verandah floor may be ten feet or more in width, and thickly
        lacquered, as in some of the Nikko temples. In common houses this
        area may be three or four feet in width. A reference to the plans
        (figs. 97 and 98; pages 113, 116), and also to the vertical section
        (<a href="#myfig103" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 103</span></a>; page 126), will give a clear idea
        of this platform and its relation to the house. There are various
        ways of treating this feature; it is always supported on wooden
        posts, rough or hewn, which, like the uprights of the house, rest on
        single stones partly buried in the ground. The space between the edge
        of the verandah and the ground is almost invariably left open, as
        will be seen by reference to figs. 37, 48, 49, 50, and 95 (pages 55,
        66, 68, 70, 106), though in Kioto houses it is sometimes filled up by
        simple boarding or panelling; and here and there are one or more
        panels which run back and forth in grooves, so that one can go
        beneath the house if necessary. The planks composing <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span> the floor of the verandah
        may be narrow or wide; usually however they are quite narrow, and run
        parallel with the edge of the verandah, though in some cages they are
        wide planks running at right angles. When this platform turns a
        corner, the ends of the planks may be mitred (as in <a href=
        "#myfig226" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        226</span></a>, A), or square (as in fig. 226, B), in which latter
        case the ends project beyond each other alternately. Sometimes the
        floor is made up of narrow strips of thick plank with the edges
        deeply chamfered or rounded (fig. 226, C). In this style a
        considerable space is left between the planks. The effect of this
        treatment is looked upon as rustic and picturesque, but is certainly
        not so pleasant to walk upon. In such a form of verandah the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> runs in a groove in close
        proximity to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The verandah
        varies considerably in its height from the ground; more often it is
        so low that one sitting on its edge may rest his feet comfortably on
        the ground. In this case a single wide block, either of stone or
        wood, forms the step. When the verandah is at a greater height from
        the ground, permanent or adjustable steps, two or three in number,
        are placed in position. A common form of verandah-step is shown in
        fig. 179 (page 199). A very good type of verandah sketched from an
        old house in Kioto is shown in fig. 227. The manner in which the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rooms in the
        second story also open upon a balcony, the platform of which is
        generally much narrower than the one below. This balcony has of
        necessity a rail or balustrade; and here much good artistic work is
        displayed in design and finish, with simple and economical devices,
        apparent as in so many other features of the house. This structure,
        with a firm hand-rail above, has the interspaces between the posts
        which support it filled with many quaint and curious devices, either
        of lattice, bamboo, or panels with perforated designs. Generally a
        narrow bar runs from post to post close to the platform, so that any
        object dropped may not roll out; between the end posts of the rail
        this piece is often removable, to allow dust and dirt to be more
        easily swept away. (In <a href="#myfig228" class=

        ornamented each panel, which was held in place by a frame composed of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems
        surprising that our architects do not oftener employ this method of
        perforation in their ornamental work,‚Äîthe designs can be so clearly
        and sharply cut, while the dark shade of the room or space beyond
        gives a depth of color to the design, which is at the same time
        permanent. With the Japanese this method of ornamentation is a
        favorite one both for outside and inside finish, and they have shown
        great ingenuity and originality in the infinite variety of designs
        for this mode of treatment. Nothing seems too difficult for them to
        attempt,‚Äîflying birds, swimming fishes, dashing waves and the rising
        sun, flowers and butterflies; indeed, the whole range of pictorial
        design has offered no difficulties to them. In their process of
        figuring cloths and crape, stencil-plates of thick paper are
        employed, and in the printing of wall-paper the same methods are
        resorted to.</p>

        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji,</span></em> but it is rare to see it used
        in a balustrade. The effect is exceedingly refined and delicate; and
        one realizes that in a country where such fragile tracery is
        incorporated in such an exposed structure, there must be an absence
        of the rough, boisterous children with whom we are familiar, and who
        in a short time would be as disastrous to a Japanese house as a
        violent earthquake and typhoon combined. One further realizes that in
        that country men must keep their feet where they properly belong.</p>

        rain-doors, by which the verandah is closed at night and during

        size of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji.</span></em> These are made <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span> of thin boards held
        together by a light frame-work having a few transverse bars. The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> run in a single groove on the
        outer edge of the verandah; at night the house is effectually closed
        by these shutters, and during hot summer nights the apartments become
        almost stifling. In many houses, however, provision is made for
        ventilation in the shape of long, narrow opening just above the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado.</span></em> Panels are made to fit into
        these openings, so that in winter the cold to some extent may be kept
        out. On unusually stormy days and during the prevalence a typhoon,
        the house closed in this way is dark and gloomy enough.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These shutters are
        the noisy features of a Japanese house. Within are no slamming doors
        or rattling latches; one admires the quiet and noiseless way in which
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> are gently pushed back and
        forth; and the soft mats yielding to the pressure of still softer
        feet, as the inmates like cats step lightly about, are soothing
        conditions to overstrained nerves and one cannot help contrasting
        them with the clatter of heavy boots on our wood floors, or the
        clouds of filthy dust kicked out of our carpets in any rough play of
        children. All these miseries are happily avoided in a Japanese house.
        Truth compels me to say, however, that in the morning you are roughly
        awakened by the servants pushing back into their appropriate recesses
        these outer wooden screens; and this act is usually noisy enough. In
        public houses this performance takes the place of clanging bell or
        tympanum-bursting gong (a Chinese instrument of torture which our
        people seem to take peculiar delight in); for not only the rattling
        bang of these resonant shutters, but the bright glare of daylight
        where before you had been immersed in darkness, assails you with a
        sudden and painful shock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese have
        a number of curious devices by which lock or bolt these shutters. So
        far as I know, the only night <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page249">[pg 249]</span> lock the house possesses is attached to
        them. So feeble are these devices that they would hardly withstand
        the attack of a toothpick in the hands of a sneak-thief. To a
        Japanese our houses must appear like veritable prisons with locks,
        bolts, and automatic catches at every opening,‚Äîthe front door with
        such mysterious devices that it is quite as impregnable from within
        as from without. What a land of thieves he must think himself in when
        he finds door-mats, door-scrapers, fountain-dippers, thermometers,
        etc., chained, screwed, or bolted to the house! The simplest device
        for locking a sliding door, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado,</span></em> is by means of a ring
        fastened to the post by the side of which the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amado</span></em>
        comes. In the frame of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> is a little loop of iron; the
        ring is pushed over the loop, and a wooden pin holds it in place.
        Another form of lock consists of an upright bolt of wood that passes
        through the upper frame of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> as well as through a
        transverse bar just below. This bolt being pushed up is held in place
        by another piece of wood, which slides along in such a way as to
        prevent the bolt from dropping back. A reference, however, to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span> the sketches
        (figs. 233, 234) will better explain the working of this ingenious
        device. Sometimes a simple wooden pin is used to hold the last
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> in place. All these various
        devices are on the last <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado;</span></em> as when this is locked, all
        the others are secured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In old houses
        round-headed iron knobs (fig 235) will be noticed on the outer edge
        of the groove in which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> run. These are placed at
        intervals corresponding to the number of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amado,</span></em>
        and are to prevent the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">amado</span></em> from being lifted out of the
        groove from the outside and thus removed. This device is rarely seen

        from slipping off the corner as they turn the post, a little iron
        roller is secured to the corner of the balcony; the <em class=

        required to close any one entrance. By reference to the plans (figs.

        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi,</span></em> a receptacle for water
        at the end of the verandah near the latrine. This convenience is
        solely for the purpose of washing the hands. This receptacle, if of
        bronze or pottery, rests on a stand or post of some kind, which rises
        from the ground near the edge of the verandah. Its importance is
        shown by the ornamental features often displayed in its structure and
        surroundings. In its simplest form it consists of a wooden bucket
        suspended by a bamboo which hangs from the eaves of the verandah
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span> roof above. To
        this bamboo hangs the dipper also (<a href="#myfig238" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 238</span></a>). A
        towel-rack usually hangs near by. A more common form of <em class=

        bronze, pottery, or porcelain, supported by a post fixed firmly in
        the ground, around the base of which is strewn a number of beach-worn
        pebbles, intermingled with larger stones; so that in washing the
        hands (which is always done by dipping the water from the vessel and
        pouring it on the hands) the water spilled finds its way through the
        pebbles, and thus an unsightly puddle of water is avoided. In simple
        forms of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi,</span></em> such as the one shown
        in fig. 49 (page 68), the pebbles are enclosed in a frame of tiles

        and sometimes circular in form.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a support to
        these vessels the quaintest devices come into play: it may be the
        trunk of a tree, from one side of which a branch springs, covered
        with leaves and blossoms; or it may be the end of a carved post from
        some old building, as shown in <a href="#myfig237" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 237</span></a>. A
        favorite support consists of a rudder-post from some old shipwreck,
        as shown in fig. 239, at a gentleman's house in the suburbs of Tokio.
        Usually the vessel is of bronze; and one often notices rare old forms
        used for this purpose, covered with a rich patina. Oftentimes water
        is conducted by a bamboo pipe, to fall in a continuous stream among
        the pebbles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many forms of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi</span></em> are in the shape of
        ponderous thick blocks of stone, with a depression on the top to hold
        the water. Of the stone forms there is an infinite variety: it may be
        a rough-hewn stone, or a square post, or an arch of stone, with a
        depression for water at the crown of the arch; indeed, the oddest
        conceits are shown in the designs for this purpose. The usual form,
        however, is cylindrical (<a href="#myfig240" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 240</span></a>); the
        stone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span> may be
        wrought in the shape of an urn (<a href="#myfig241" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 241</span></a>).
        Whatever the form, however, they are generally monoliths.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Usually the stone
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi</span></em> has a little wooden
        frame-work with roof resting on the top, to keep dead leaves from
        falling into the water. Large irregular-shaped stones, having
        depressions in them for water, may be seen near the entrance of the
        little buildings used for the ceremonial tea-parties; in this case
        the stone rests directly upon the ground. While in most cases the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi</span></em> is but slightly removed
        from the edge of the verandah, so that one may easily reach it with
        the dipper which always rests upon the top of the vessel, in more
        elaborate surroundings a little platform called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hisashi-yen</span></em> is built out from the
        edge of the verandah. This platform has a floor of bamboo rods, or
        circular or hexagonal bars of wood. A hand-rail often borders this
        platform, and a quaint old iron lantern usually hangs from above, to
        light the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        ingenuity are shown here, as elsewhere, in making this corner refined
        and artistic. Rare woods and expensive rock-work enter into its
        composition; beautiful flowers, climbing vines, and dwarf-pines are
        clustered about it; and books are specially prepared to illustrate
        the many ways in which this convenience may be dealt
        with.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span>

        attempt at architectural display is made on that side of the house
        that comes next the street, the gateway, on the contrary, receives a
        good deal of attention, and many of these entrances are quite
        remarkable for their design and structure. These, like the fences,
        vary greatly as to their lightness or solidity. The gateways
        bordering the street are often of the most solid description,‚Äîwell
        barred within, having a roof above them, and when painted black, as
        they often are, looking grim enough. Whether solid or light, however,
        the gateways are usually picturesque. Rustic effects are frequently
        seen, even in the gateways of the city houses; though often frail in
        appearance, it is rare to see one in ruins, or even in a dilapidated
        condition. Many of them are made of light thin material, though the
        upright posts are stout timbers well braced behind <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span> by supplementary posts,
        with strong cross-beams above. Often quaint old ship-planks or rugged
        and twisted branches form frame-work for the most delicate panelling
        of braided strips or perforated designs, with flattened strips of
        dark bamboo forming the centre ribs of a series of panels. All these
        contrasts of strong and frail, rough and delicate in design,
        material, and execution, are the surprises which give such a charm to
        Japanese work of this nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        different types of gateways. In the city, one type is seen in the
        long row of buildings which form part of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yashiki</span></em>
        inclosure; these are solid and ponderous structures. A gateway of a
        similar kind is seen in the thick high walls of tile, mud, and
        plaster which surround a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashiki.</span></em> Another type is seen, in
        which the gateway is flanked on either side by tall, light,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span> wooden or close
        bamboo fences; and still another, which is found in the garden
        fences, and is often of the lightest description.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the first kind
        forming the entrance to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yashiki,</span></em> the building of which have
        not been considered in this work, a rough sketch is given in <a href=
        "#myfig242" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig.
        242</span></a>. This is a gateway belonging to a small <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yashiki</span></em>
        not far from Kudan in Tokio, which opens into a long low building
        solid and heavy in construction. The larger gateway has on either
        side a narrow opening for ordinary passage. A heavily-barred and
        protected window on one side is provided for the gatekeeper, from
        which he can see any one that passes in or out; the narrow though
        deep moat in front is bridged by stone. The gateway, though solid,
        appears far more solid than it is; the gates are apparently studded
        with heavy round-headed bolts, which as we have seen are often of
        pretentious solidity, being made of the thinnest sheet-metal and
        lightly attached. The broad metal straps, sockets, and bindings of
        the various beams are of the same sheet-copper. Gateways of this
        nature are often painted black or bright red, and in the olden times
        were wonderfully decorated with color and metal work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of another group
        are the ordinary gateways of the better class of city houses.
        <a href="#myfig243" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 243</span></a> is a typical one of this
        description. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span>
        The sketch shows the appearance of the gateway from within, and
        illustrates the way in which the upright posts are strengthened by
        additional posts and braces. The double gates are held together, by a
        strong wooden bar, after the manner of similar gateways at home. In
        gateways of this description there is usually a small sliding door,
        its lower edge a foot from the ground, just high enough for a person
        to crawl through in a stooping attitude. For an alien resident to get
        in or out of this opening without tripping, or knocking off his hat,
        requires considerable skill and practice. When this little grated
        door is slid back it is sometimes arranged to jangle a bell, or to
        rattle a number of pieces of iron hung by a string, as a warning to
        the servant within. Sometimes this supplementary opening has a
        swinging instead of a sliding door; in this case a curious rattle is
        arranged by tying a number of short segments of bamboo to a piece of
        board which is hung to the gate: these rattle quite loudly whenever
        the gate is moved. <a href="#myfig244" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig. 244</span></a>
        illustrates the appearance of this primitive yet ingenious

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A number of
        curious ways are devised to lock the little sliding door in the
        gateway, one of which is here figured (fig. 245.) To the left of the
        drawing a portion of the door is shown. A piece hanging from a panel
        in the gate is held against the edge of the door by a sliding bolt,
        which, when pushed back, drops into place, allowing the door to slide
        by. It is, however, difficult to make this clear by description; a
        reference to fig. 245 will illustrate it. Not only do the larger
        gates have these smaller openings, but in the street-entrance of
        shops and inns the door which closes the entrance has a little door
        either hinged or on rollers. This is called the earthquake door, as
        through this in times of sudden danger the inmates escape, the larger
        doors or rain-shutters being liable to get bound or jammed in the
        swaying of the building.</p>

        light coping held in place by two brackets <span class="tei tei-pb"

        attractive gateway is accomplished. In this figure the durable way in
        which a fence is constructed is well shown. The stout wooden sills
        supported by flat stones, which in turn rest on the stone wall, may
        here be seen; and the interspace showing between the lower edge of
        the boards and the sill is a common feature of fence-structure. A

        gateway one of the panels slides in a groove behind the other panel,
        which is fixed. These panels are filled with a braiding of thin
        strips of cedar. Above these low panels is a stout net-work of wood.
        The round gate-posts are held together above by a round beam as well
        as by a wide and thin plank, in which is cut in perforated pattern a
        graceful design. The roof of the gate is made of wide thin boards,
        supported by transverse pieces passing through the upright posts and
        keyed into place. The door-plate, consisting of a thin board upon
        which the name of the occupant is painted, is nailed to the post.</p>

        Shinagawa, near Tokio. It was remarkable for the beauty of its
        proportions and the purity of its design. The two upright posts
        consisted of the natural trunks of trees <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page261">[pg 261]</span> stripped of their bark, showing the
        prominences left by the removal of their branches. The transverse
        piece crowning the whole had been specially selected to give an
        upward curve to its ends, such as one sees in the upper transverse
        beam of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tori-i.</span></em><a id="noteref_21" name=

        been cut on three of its faces, one answering to its lower face, and
        the other two to bring it in line with the gate; and these surfaces
        gave a picturesque effect by intersecting the irregularities of the
        trunk, producing a waved and irregular section. Directly below this
        beam was a black worm-eaten plank from some old shipwreck, and
        immediately below this was another transverse tie in the shape of a
        huge green bamboo. The gate itself was composed of light narrow
        strips placed half an inch apart, between which could be seen four
        transverse bars within. A small square area in one corner was framed
        in for the little supplementary entrance. The gate was flanked on
        each side by wings composed of boards, and capped with a heavy wooden
        rail; and these wings joined the neatest of bamboo fences, which
        rested on a stone foundation, which in turn formed the inner wall of
        the street gutter. Heavy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span> slabs of dressed stone made a bridge across the gutter,
        and in front of the gateway was an irregular-shaped flag-stone,
        showing untouched its natural cleavage from the ledge; on each side
        and about this slab the ground was paved with round beach-worn
        cobble-stones. This gateway was exceedingly attractive; and there is
        no reason why just such an entrance, with perhaps the exception of

        the suburbs of Tokio and farther south. Its roof is quite large and
        complex, yet not heavy. The gate has a wide over-hanging roof of
        bark; the ridge consists of large bamboos placed longitudinally in
        two sets, each set being kept apart from each other as well as from
        the roof by thick saddles of bark resting across the ridge, the whole
        mass tied together and to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg

        being twisted above into an ornamental plume. Smaller bamboos are
        placed at intervals nearly to the eaves of the roof. The rafters
        below were of different sizes and shapes in section, being round and
        square. The sketch will more fully explain the structure.</p>

        one, two rough logs form the posts, the fence being composed of large
        bamboos in sets of three, alternating on either side of the rails to
        which they are tied. This was a portal simply. The other had smooth
        round gateposts with a light wooden gate with braided panel, and the
        fence of each side was composed of rush. These gateways and fences
        were introduced as pleasing effects in the garden.</p>

        Miyajima the deer come down from the woods and wander through the
        streets. To prevent them from entering the houses and gardens, the
        passages are guarded by the lightest of latticed gates, against which
        hangs a weight suspended from above by a cord or long bamboo. The
        weight answers a double purpose by keeping the gate closed, and also
        when opened by a caller, by banging loudly against it, thus
        attracting the attention of a servant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Large folding
        gates are often fastened by a transverse bar not unlike the way in
        which gates are fastened in our country. For light-folding gates an
        iron ring fastened to one gate by <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        the tea-ceremonies, and the huge fish seen hanging up at the left is
        made of wood, and gives out a resonant sound when struck; it is the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The variety in
        design and structure of fences seems almost inexhaustible. Many of
        them are solid and durable structures, others of the lightest
        possible description,‚Äîsome made with solid frame and heavy stakes,
        and others of wisps of rush and sticks of bamboo; and between these
        is an infinite variety of intermediate forms. A great diversity of
        material enters into the structure of these fences,‚Äîheavy timbers,
        light boards, sticks of red-pine, bamboo, reed, twigs, and fagots.
        Bundles of rush, and indeed almost every kind of plant that can be
        bound into bundles or sustain its own weight are brought into
        requisition in the composition of these boundary partitions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fences have
        special names, either derived from their form or the substances from
        which they are made; thus, a little ornamental fence that juts out
        from the side of a house or wall is called a <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        different groups of Japanese fences. Under one group may be mentioned
        all those enclosing the ground upon which the house stands. In the
        city these are often quite tall, usually built of boards, and
        supported on solid frames resting on a foundation of stone. In the
        country such fences are hardly more than trellises of bamboo, and
        these of the lightest description. Many of the fences are strictly
        ornamental, consisting either of light trellises bounding certain
        areas, or forming little screens jutting from the side of the house,
        or from the side of more durable fences or walls. Of these the
        designs are endless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us examine
        more in detail some of the principal Japanese types of fences. A
        simple board-fence consists, as with us, of an upper and lower
        cross-tie, to which the boards are nailed. A useful modification of
        the ordinary board-fence consists in having the upper and lower rails
        of thick board, three or four inches wide, and nailed sideways to the
        fence-posts. The fence-boards are nailed to these rails alternately
        on one side and on the other. A pretty effect is produced by the
        interrupted appearance of the rails, and a useful purpose also is
        subserved by lessening the pressure of the wind which so often blows
        with great violence, since by securing the boards in this way
        interspaces occur between the boards the width of the rails. <a href=
        "#myfig254" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        254</span></a> illustrates a portion of this kind of fence, with its
        appearance in section as seen from above. This feature in board
        fences might be imitated with advantage in our country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heavy stake fences
        are made by mortising each stake, which consists of a stout square
        piece, and running the rail through the mortises thus made, and then
        pinning each stake in position. In many fences of this kind there are
        two rails near together, while the lower ends of the stakes are
        secured to a foundation-piece, or sill, which is raised an inch or
        two from the ground by stone props at intervals. By this treatment
        the sill is preserved both from the ravages of insects and the
        dampness of the ground. <a href="#myfig255" class=

        appearance of this kind of fence. Such fences are made more secure by
        driving into the ground additional posts at a distance of two feet or
        more, and binding them together by rails, as shown in the gateway

        bamboo stakes are held in place by their elasticity. It will be
        observed that the post supporting this fence, and also showing the
        side of a gateway, is marked in a curious fashion. This post is a
        stout stick of wood in its natural state, the bark only being
        removed. The design, in a rich brown color, is in this case in the
        form of diamond-shaped spaces, though spiral lines, like those on a
        barber's pole, are often seen. This design is burned in, and the wood
        being carbonized is consequently insoluble as well as unchangeable in
        color. I was curious to know how such a design was burned in this
        formal pattern, and learned that a long stout rope, or band of straw
        soaked in water, was first wound around the post in a wide spiral, in
        two directions, leaving diamond-shaped interspaces. A bed of hot
        coals being prepared, the post was exposed to this heat, and the wood
        not protected by the wet straw-band became charred. This simple yet
        ingenious way of getting plain decorations, in a rich brown and
        lasting color, is one that might be utilized in a variety of ways by
        American architects.</p>

        of fence, in which are hundreds of different designs,‚Äîsquare tops,
        curving tops, circular or concave edges, panels cut out, and an
        infinite variety shown in the minor details. This kind of fence is
        always built out from the side of the house or from a more permanent
        fence or wall. It is rarely over four or five feet in length, and is
        strictly ornamental, though often useful in screening some feature of
        the house that is desired to be concealed.</p>

        GARDENS.</span></h1><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
        273]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese
        garden, like the house, presents features that never enter into
        similar places in America. With us it is either modelled after
        certain French styles, or it is simply beds of flowers in patches or
        formal plats, or narrow beds bordering the paths; and even these
        attempts are generally made on large areas only. The smaller gardens
        seen around our ordinary dwellings are with few exceptions a tangle
        of bushes, or wretched attempts to crowd as many different kinds of
        flowers as possible into a given area; and when winter comes, there
        is nothing left but a harvest of dead stalks and a lot of
        hideously-designed trellises painted green.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is no wonder,
        then, that as our people have gradually become awakened within recent
        years to some idea of fitness and harmony of color, the conventional
        flower-bed has been hopelessly abandoned, and now green grass grows
        over the graves of most of these futile attempts to defy Nature. The
        grass substitute has at least the merit of not being offensive to the
        eye, and of requiring but little care save that of the strenuous
        pushing of the mechanical grass-cutter. This substitute is, however,
        a confession of inability and ignorance,‚Äîas much as if a decorator,
        after having struggled in vain with his fresco designs upon some
        ceiling, should give up in disgust and paint the entire surface one
        color.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The secret in a
        Japanese garden is that they do not attempt too much. That reserve
        and sense of propriety which characterize this people in all their
        decorative and other artistic work are here seen to perfection.
        Furthermore, in the midst of so much that is evanescent they see the
        necessity of providing enduring points of interest in the way of
        little ponds and bridges, odd-shaped stone lanterns and inscribed
        rocks, summer-houses and rustic fences, quaint paths of stone and
        pebble, and always a number of evergreen trees and shrubs. We,
        indeed, have feebly groped that way with our cement vases, jigsaw
        pavilions green with poisonous compound, and cast-iron fountains of
        such design that one no longer wonders at the increase of insanity in
        our midst. One of every hundred of the fountains that our people dote
        upon is in the form of two little cast-iron children standing in a
        cast-iron basin, holding over their heads a sheet-iron umbrella, from
        the point of which squirts a stream of water,‚Äîa perennial shower for
        them alone, while the grass and all about may be sear and yellow with
        the summer's drought!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese have
        brought their garden arts to such perfection that a plot of ground
        ten feet square is capable of being exquisitely beautified by their
        methods. Plots of ground that in this country are too often
        encumbered with coal-ashes, tea-grounds, tin cans, and the
        garbage-barrel, in Japan are rendered charming to the eye by the
        simplest means. With cleanliness, simplicity, a few little evergreen
        shrubs, one or two little clusters of flowers, a rustic fence
        projecting from the side of the house, a quaintly shaped flower-pot
        or two, containing a few choice plants,‚Äîthe simplest form of garden
        is attained. So much do the Japanese admire gardens, and garden
        effects, that their smallest strips of ground are utilized for this
        purpose. In the crowded city, among the poorest houses, one often
        sees, in the corner of a little earth-area that comes between the
        sill and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span> the
        raised floor, a miniature garden made in some shallow box, or even on
        the ground itself. In gardens of any pretensions, a little pond or
        sheet of water of irregular outline is an indispensable feature. If a
        brook can be turned to run through the garden, one of the great
        charms is attained; and a diminutive water-fall gives all that can be
        desired. With the aid of fragments of rock and rounded boulders, the
        picturesque features of a brook can be brought out; little rustic
        bridges of stone and wood span it, and even the smallest pond will
        have a bridge of some kind thrown across. A few small hummocks and a
        little mountain six or eight feet high, over or about which the path
        runs, are nearly always present.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In gardens of
        larger size these little mountains are sometimes twenty, thirty, and
        even forty feet in height, and are built up from the level ground
        with great labor and expense. On top of these a little rustic lookout
        with thatched roof is made, from which if a view of Fuji can be got
        the acme is indeed reached. In still larger gardens,‚Äîthat is, gardens
        measuring several hundred feet each way,‚Äîthe ponds and bridges, small
        hills and meandering paths, with shrubs trimmed in round balls of
        various sizes, and grotesquely-shaped pines with long tortuous
        branches running near the ground, are all combined in such a way by
        the skilful landscape gardener that the area seems, without
        exaggeration of statement, ten times as vast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irregularly and
        grotesquely shaped stones and huge slabs of rock form an important
        feature of all gardens; indeed, it is as difficult to imagine a
        Japanese garden without a number of picturesque and oddly-shaped
        stones as it is to imagine an American garden without flowers. In
        Tokio, for example, there being near the city no proper rocks of this
        kind for garden decoration, rocks and stones are often transported
        forty or fifty <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span>
        miles for this purpose alone. There are stone-yards in which one may
        see and purchase rocks such as one might use in building a rough
        cellar-wall at home, and also sea-worn rocks of various shapes and
        colors,‚Äîamong them red-colored stones, that fetch a hundred dollars
        and more, brought from Sado, an island on the northwest coast of
        Japan. So much do the Japanese admire stones and rocks for garden
        decoration, that in their various works on the subject of
        garden-making the proper arrangement of stones is described and
        figured with painstaking minuteness. In the figures to be given of
        Japanese gardens, reproduced from a work entitled <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúChikusan Teizoden,‚Äù</span> written in the early part of
        the last century, the arrangement of rocks in the various garden
        designs will be observed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tablets of rock,
        not unlike a certain type of gravestone, and showing the rough
        cleavage of the rock from the parent ledge, are often erected in
        gardens. Upon the face of the rock some appropriate inscription is
        engraved. The accompanying sketch (<a href="#myfig263" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 263</span></a>) is a
        tablet of this sort, from a famous tea-garden at Omori, celebrated
        for its plum-blossoms. The legend, freely translated, runs as
        follows: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe sight of the plum-blossom
        causes the ink to flow in the writing-room,‚Äù</span>‚Äîmeaning that one
        is inspired to compose poetry under the influence of these
        surroundings. This tablet was raised on a slight mound, with steps
        leading to it and quaint pines and shrubs surrounding it. The sketch
        gives only a suggestion of its appearance.</p>

        common yet important accompaniments of garden decoration. Indeed, it
        is rare to see a garden, even of small size, without one or more of
        these curious objects. They are usually wrought out of soft volcanic
        rock, and ordinary ones may be bought for a few dollars. They
        resemble stout stone-posts of various contours, round, square,
        hexagonal, or octagonal; or the upper part may be hexagonal, while
        the shaft supporting it may be a round pillar; or they may be of
        irregular form, built of water-worn rock. The upper portion is
        hollowed out, leaving various openings cut in ornamental shape; and
        in this cavity a lamp or candle is placed on special occasions. They
        are generally made in two or three sections. There are at least three
        distinct types,‚Äîshort and broad ones with tops shaped like a
        mushroom, these generally standing on three or four legs; tall,
        slender ones; and a third form composed of a number of sections piled
        up to a considerable height, looking like a pagoda, which, for all I
        know, they may be made to imitate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The summer-houses
        are simple and picturesque; sometimes they have a seat and a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">do-ma,</span></em> or earth floor; others will
        have a board or a matted floor. These houses are generally open, the
        square thatched roof being supported on four corner-posts; others
        again will have two sides closed by permanent partitions,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span> in one of which
        an ornamental opening or window occurs. We cannot understand what so
        intelligent an observer as Rein means when he makes the statement
        that the Japanese garden contains no summer-house,‚Äîfor it is rare to
        see a garden of any magnitude without one, and impossible to refer to
        any Japanese book on the subject in which these little rustic
        shelters and resting-places are not figured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The training of
        vines and trees about the summer-house window is often delightfully
        conceived. We recall the circular window of one that presented a most
        beautiful appearance. Three sides of the summer-house were closed by
        permanent plaster partitions, tinted a rich brown color, with a very
        broad-eaved thatched roof throwing its dark shade on the matted
        floor. In the partition opposite the open side was a perfectly
        circular window five feet in diameter. There was no frame or moulding
        to this opening, simply the plastering finished squarely at the
        border; dark-brown bamboos of various thicknesses, secured across
        this opening horizontally, formed the frame-work; running vertically,
        and secured to the bamboo, was a close grating of brown rush. Over
        and around this window‚Äîit being on the sunny side‚Äîthere had been
        carefully trained outside a vine with rich green leaves, so that the
        window was more or less shaded by it. The effect of the sunlight
        falling upon the vine was exquisite beyond description. When two or
        three leaves interposed between the sun's rays, the color was a rich
        dark green; where here and there, over the whole mass, a single leaf
        only interrupted the light, there were bright green flashes, like
        emerald gems; at points the dazzling sunlight glinted like sparks. In
        a few places the vine and leaves had been coaxed through the grating
        of rushes, and these were consequently in deep shadow. I did not
        attempt to sketch it, as no drawing could possibly convey an idea of
        the exceeding richness and charm of the effect, with the cool and
        shaded room within, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg
        281]</span> dark-brown lattice of bamboo and rush, the capacious
        round opening, and, above all, the effect of the various rich
        greens,‚Äîwhich was greatly heightened as the wind tremulously shifted
        the leafy screens without, and thus changed the arrangement of the
        emerald colors within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My attention was
        first attracted to it by noticing a number of Japanese peering at it
        through an open fence, and admiring in rapt delight this charming
        conception. Such a room and window might easily be arranged in our
        gardens, as we have a number of vines with light, translucent leaves
        capable of being utilized in this way.</p>

        a raised floor, the edge of which formed a seat, and two plastered
        partitions at right angles, in one of which was cut a circular
        window, and in the other a long, narrow opening above; and crowning
        the whole was a heavily-thatched roof, its peak capped by an inverted
        earthen basin. Whether the basin was made expressly for this purpose
        or not, its warm red color added a pleasing effect to the gray of the
        thatch. In front and about it stones and rocks were arranged in
        pleasing disorder, while a number of exotic flowers and quaintly
        trimmed shrubs added their charms, and a little brook found its way
        across the path leading to it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        gardens in Tokio. The frame, as in the one last figured, consisted of
        round sticks with the bark retained; this was capped with a thatched
        roof, surmounted by a ridge of thatch and bamboo. A very pretty
        feature was shown in the trellises, which sprung diagonally from each
        post,‚Äîthe frame of these trellises consisting of tree-branches
        selected for their irregular forms. The lattice was made of bamboo
        and rush, and each trellis had a different design. The seat within
        was of porcelain; and about the slight mound on which the
        summer-house stood were curiously-trimmed shrubs and dwarfed
        pines.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The openings or
        windows in these summer-houses are often remarkable for their curious

        the appearance of these rustic openings,‚Äîone representing a gourd,
        its frame being made of grape-vine; the other suggesting a mountain,

        trained so that it spreads like a fan, in one direction, to a width
        of thirty feet or more, while it may not be over two feet in
        thickness. An infinite amount of patient work is required in tying
        all the big branches and little twigs to bamboo supports in order to
        bring trees into such strange forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the garden of
        Fukiage, in Tokio, some very marvellous effects of
        landscape-gardening are seen. At a distance you notice high ground, a
        hill in fact, perhaps fifty or sixty feet in height; approaching it
        from a plain of rich green grass you cross a little lake, bridged at
        one point by a single slab of rock; then up a ravine, down which a
        veritable mountain brook is tumbling, and through a rock foundation
        so natural, that, until a series of faults and dislocations,
        synclinals and anticlinals, in rapid succession arouse your
        geological memories with a rude shock, you cannot believe that all
        this colossal mass of material has been transported here by man, from
        distances to be measured by leagues; and that a few hundred years ago
        a low plain existed where now are rocky ravines and dark dells, with
        heavy forest trees throwing their cool shadows over all. You wend
        your way by a picturesque forest-path to the summit of the hill,
        which is crowned by a rustic summer-house with wide verandah, from
        which a beautiful view of Fuji is got. Looking back towards the park,
        you expect to see the ravine below, but, to your amazement, an
        absolutely flat plain of shrubbery, resembling a closely-cropped tea
        plantation, level to the top of the hill and extending to a
        considerable distance, greets your <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page284">[pg 284]</span> eye. Have you lost the points of the
        compass? Walking out in the direction of this level growth of
        shrubbery, a new surprise awaits you; for peering through the bushes,
        you look down the slopes of the steep hill you had ascended. The
        forest-trees which thickly cover the slopes of the hill had been
        trimmed above to an absolute level; and this treatment had gone on
        for so many years that the tops formed a dense mass having the
        appearance, from the summer-house, of a continuous stretch of low
        shrubs springing from a level ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have spoken of
        the love the Japanese have for gardens and garden effects, the
        smallest areas of ground being utilized for this purpose. As an
        illustration of this, I recall an experience in a cheap inn, where I
        was forced to take a meal or go hungry till late at night. The
        immediate surroundings indicated poverty, the house itself being
        poorly furnished, the mats hard and uneven, and the attendants very
        cheaply dressed. In the room where our meal was served there was a
        circular window, through which could be seen a curious stone lantern
        and a pine-tree, the branches of which stretched across the opening,
        while beyond a fine view of some high mountains was to be had. From
        where we sat on the mats there were all the evidences of a fine
        garden outside; and wondering how so poor a house could sustain so
        fine a garden, I went to the window to investigate. What was my
        surprise to find that the extent of ground from which the lantern and
        pine-tree sprung was just three feet in width! Then came a low
        board-fence, and beyond this stretched the rice-fields of a
        neighboring farmer. At home such a narrow strip of land would in all
        likelihood have been the receptacle for broken glass and tin cans,
        and a thoroughfare for erratic cats; here, however, everything was
        clean and neat,‚Äîand this narrow plot of ground, good for no other
        purpose, had been utilized solely for the benefit of the room
        within.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reference has been
        made to the ponds and brooks as desirable features in garden-making.
        Where water is not obtainable for the purpose, or possibly for the
        ingenuity of the idea, the Japanese sometimes make a deceptive pond,
        which is absolutely destitute of water; so perfectly, however, are
        the various features of the pond carried out, that the effect of
        water is produced by the illusion of association. The pond is laid
        out in an irregular outline, around the border of which plant-pots
        buried out of sight contain the iris and a number of plants which
        naturally abound near wet shores. The bottom of the pond is lined
        with little gray pebbles, and a rustic bridge leads to a little
        island in the centre. The appearance of this dry pond from the
        verandah is most deceptive.</p>

        contain either lotus or other aquatic plants, or they may be given up

        lanterns standing at their ends like miniature light-houses, rustic
        arbors or seats, trellises above supporting a luxuriant growth of
        wistaria, and tortuous pines with long branches reaching out over the
        water, are a few of the many features which add so much to that
        peculiar charm so characteristic of Japanese gardens.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pathways of
        stone are of many kinds. Sometimes the slabs of stone may be finished
        squarely, and then each may be arranged in line across the path, or
        adjusted in such a way from one side to the other that a zigzag path
        is made; in other cases the path may consist of long slabs squarely
        trimmed, or of large irregular slabs interrupted with little stones,
        all compacted into the hard earth. <a href="#myfig275" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the most
        extraordinary objects connected with gardens are the dwarf
        plum-trees. Before the evidence of life <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page287">[pg 287]</span> appears in the blooming, one would
        certainly believe that a collection of dwarf plum-trees were simply
        fragments of old blackened and distorted branches or roots,‚Äîas if
        fragments of dead wood had been selected for the purpose of grotesque
        display! Indeed, nothing more hopeless for flowers or life could be
        imagined than the appearance of these irregular, flattened, and even
        perforated sticks and stumps. They are kept in the house on the sunny
        side, and while the snow is yet on the ground, send out long,
        delicate drooping twigs, which are soon strung with a wealth of the
        most beautiful rosy-tinted blossoms it is possible to conceive; and,
        cunously enough not a trace of a green leaf appears during all this
        luxuriant blossoming.</p>

        278</span></a> is an attempt to show the appearance of one of these
        phenomenal plum-trees. It was over forty years old, and stood about
        three feet high. By what horticultural sorcery life had been kept in
        this blackened stump, only a Japanese gardener knows. And such a
        vitality! Not a few feeble twigs and blossoms as an expiring effort,
        but a delicious growth of the most vigorous and dainty flowers. The
        pines are equally remarkable in their way. It is very curious to see
        a sturdy old pine-tree, masculine and gruff in its gnarled branches
        and tortuous trunk, perhaps forty or fifty years old, and yet not
        over two feet in height, and growing in a flower-pot; or a thick
        chunk of pine standing upright in a flower-pot, and sending out
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span> vigorous
        branches covered with leaves (<a href="#myfig279" class=

        others trained in ways that seem incredible.</p>

        another one, in which the branches had been trained to assume the
        appearance of flattened disks (fig. 281). It would seem as if the
        artistic and picturesque taste of the gardener followed the shrubs
        even to their winter shrouds of straw; for when they are enwrapped
        for the winter's cold and snow, the objects even in this guise look

        represent respectively a little garden belonging to the priests'

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a remarkable
        fact that the various trees and shrubs which adorn a Japanese garden
        may be successfully transplanted again and again without impairing
        their vitality. Trees of very large size may be seen, almost daily,
        being dragged through the streets on their way from one garden to
        another. A man may have a vigorous and healthy garden under way in
        the space of a few days,‚Äîtrees forty or fifty feet high, and as many
        years old, sturdy shrubs and tender plants, all possessing a vitality
        and endurance under the intelligent management of a Japanese
        gardener, which permits them to be transported from one end of the
        city to the other. If for some reason the owner has to give up his
        place, every stone and ornamental fence, and every tree and plant
        having its commercial value, may all be dug up and sold and spirited
        away, in a single day, to some other part of the town. And such a
        vicissitude often falls to the lot of a Japanese garden, enduring as
        it is. The whole affair, save the circular well-hole, may be
        transported like magic from one end of the country to the other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the exception
        of a few of the larger cities, the water-supply of Japan is by means
        of wooden wells sunk in the ground. In Tokio, besides the ordinary
        forms of wells which are found in every portion of the city, there is
        a system of aqueducts conveying water from the Tamagawa a distance of
        twenty-four miles, and from Kanda a distance of ten miles or more. It
        is hardly within the province of this work to call attention to the
        exceeding impurity of much of the well-water in Tokio and elsewhere
        in Japan, as shown by many analyses, or to the imperfect way in which
        water is conveyed from remote places to Tokio and Yokohama. For
        valuable and interesting papers on this subject the reader is
        referred to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Japan.<a id=
        "noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=

        id="page297">[pg 297]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aqueducts in
        the city are made of wood, either in the shape of heavy square plank
        tubes or circular wooden pipes. These various conductors are
        intersected by open wells, in which the water finds its natural
        level, only partially filling them. These wells are to be found in
        the main streets as well as in certain open areas; and to them the
        people come, not only to get their water, but often to do light
        washing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time must soon
        come when the authorities of Tokio will find it absolutely necessary
        to establish water-works for the supply of the city. Such a change
        from the present system would require an enormous expenditure at the
        outset, but in the end the community will be greatly benefited, not
        only in having more efficient means to quell the awful conflagrations
        which so frequently devastate their thoroughfares, but also in having
        a more healthful water-supply for family use. In their present
        imperfect method of water-service it is impossible to keep the supply
        free from local contamination; and though the death-rate of the city
        is low compared with that of many European <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page298">[pg 298]</span> and American cities, it would certainly
        be still further reduced by pure water made available to all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many country
        villages, where the natural conditions exist, a mountain brook is
        conducted by a rock-bound canal through the centre of the village
        street; and thus the water for culinary and other purposes is brought
        directly to the door of every house on that street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wells are made
        in the shape of barrels of stout staves five or six feet in height.
        These taper slightly at their lower ends, and are fitted one within
        another; and as the well is dug; deeper the sections are adjusted and
        driven down. Wells of great depth are often sunk in this way. The
        well made in this manner has the appearance, as it projects above the
        ground, of an ordinary barrel or hogshead partially buried.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stone curbs of a
        circular form are often seen. An ancient form of well-curb is a
        square frame, made of thick timber in the shape shown in fig. 287.
        The Chinese character for <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwell‚Äù</span> is in
        the shape of this frame; and as one rides through the city or village
        he will often notice this character painted on the side of a house or

        well is to be found. A picturesque well-curb of stone, made after
        this form, is shown in <a href="#myfig288" class=

        usually brought up by means of a bucket attached to the end of a long
        bamboo, there are various forms of frames erected over the well to
        support a pulley, in which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        ways of conveying water to villages by bamboo pipes. In Kioto many
        places are supplied by water brought in this way from the mountain
        brooks back of the city. At Miyajima, on the Inland Sea, water is
        brought, by means of bamboo pipes, from a mountain stream at the
        western end of the village. The water is first conveyed to a single
        shallow tank, supported on a rough pedestal of rock. The tank is
        perforated at intervals along its sides and on its end, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span> by means of
        bamboo gutters the water is conveyed to bamboo tubes standing
        vertically,‚Äîeach bamboo having at its top a box or bucket, in which
        is a grating of bamboo to screen the water from the leaves and twigs.
        These bamboo tubes are connected with a system of bamboo tubes
        under-ground, and these lead to the houses in the village street
        below. <a href="#myfig291" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">Fig. 291</span></a> is an illustration of this
        structure. It was an old and leaky affair, but formed a picturesque
        mass beside the mountain road, covered as it was by a rich growth of
        ferns and mosses, and brightened by the water dripping from all
        points.</p>

        this large inclosure are a number of treacherous holes guarded only
        by fences painted black. These are the remains of wells; and by their
        number one gets a faint idea of the dense commununity that filled
        this area in the days of the Shogunate. During the Revolution the
        houses were burned, and with them the wooden curbs of the wells, and
        for many years these deep holes formed dreadful pitfalls in the long

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effect of
        rusticity which the Japanese so much admire, and which they show in
        their gateways, fences, and other surroundings, is charmingly carried
        out in the wells; and the presence of a well in a garden is looked
        upon as adding greatly to its beauty. Hence, one sees quaint and
        picturesque curbs, either of stone and green with plant growth, or of
        wood and fairly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span>
        dropping to pieces with decay. One sees literally a moss-covered
        bucket and well, too; but, alas! the water is not the cold, pure
        fluid which a New Englander is accustomed to draw from similar places
        at home, but often a water far from wholesome, and which to make so
        is generally boiled before drinking. We refer now to the city wells;
        and yet the country wells are quite as liable to contamination.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having described
        in the previous pages the permanent features of the house and its
        surroundings, a few pages may be properly added concerning those
        objects which are hung upon the walls as adornments. A few objects of
        household use have been mentioned, such as pillows, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hibachi,
        tabako-bon,</span></em> candlesticks, and towel-racks, as naturally
        associated with mats, kitchen, bathing conveniences, etc. Any further
        consideration of these movable objects would lead us into a
        discussion of the bureaus, chests, baskets, trays, dishes, and the
        whole range of domestic articles of use, and might, indeed, furnish
        material enough for another volume.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few pages,
        however, must be added on the adornments of the room, and the
        principles which govern the Japanese in these matters. As flowers
        form the most universal decoration of the rooms from the highest to
        the lowest classes, these will be first considered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The love of
        flowers is a national trait of the Japanese. It would be safe to say
        that in no other part of the world is the love of flowers so
        universally shown as in Japan. For pictorial illustration flowers
        form one of the most common themes; and for decorative art in all its
        branches flowers, in natural or conventional shapes, are selected as
        the leading motive. In their light fabrics,‚Äîembroidery, pottery,
        lacquers, wall-papers, fans,‚Äîand even in their metal work and
        bronzes, these charming and perishable objects are constantly
        depicted and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span>
        wrought. In their social life, also, these things are always present.
        From birth to death, flowers are in some way associated with the
        daily life of the Japanese; and for many years after their death
        their graves continue to receive fresh floral tributes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A room in the very
        humblest of houses will have in its place of honor‚Äîthe <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma‚Äî</span></em>
        a flower-vase, or a section of bamboo hanging from its side, or some
        form of receptacle suspended from the open portion of the room above,
        or in front of some ornamental opening in which flowers are
        displayed. On the street one often meets the flower vendor; and at
        night, flower fairs are one of the most common attractions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arrangement of
        flowers forms a part of the polite education of the Japanese, and
        special rules and methods for their appropriate display have their
        schools and teachers. Within the house there are special places where
        it is proper to display flowers. In the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em>
        as we have said, is generally a vase of bronze or pottery in which
        flowers are placed,‚Äînot the heterogeneous mass of color comprised in
        a jumble of flowers, as is too often the case with us; but a few
        flowers of one kind, or a big branch of cherry or plum blossoms are
        quite enough to satisfy the refined tastes of these people. Here, as
        in other matters, the Japanese show their sense of propriety and
        infinite refinement. They most thoroughly abominate our slovenly
        methods, whereby a clump of flowers of heterogeneous colors are
        packed and jammed together, with no room for green leaves: this we
        call a bouquet; and very properly, since it resembles a ball,‚Äîa
        variegated worsted ball. These people believe in the healthy contrast
        of rough brown stem and green leaves, to show off by texture and
        color the matchless life-tones of the delicate petals. We, however,
        in our stupidity are too often accustomed to tear off the flowers
        that Nature has so deftly arranged on their own <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span> wood stems, and then with
        thread and bristling wire to fabricate a feeble resemblance to the
        milliner's honest counterfeit of cloth and paper; and by such
        treatment, at the end of a few hours, we have a mass equally
        lifeless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their
        flower-vases, too, they show the most perfect knowledge of contrasts.
        To any one of taste it is unnecessary to show how inappropriate our
        gilt and often brilliantly colored; flower-vases are for the objects
        they are to hold. By employing such receptacles, all effects of color
        and pleasing contrasts are effectually ruined. The Japanese
        flower-vase is often made of the roughest and coarsest pottery, with
        rough patches of glaze and irregular contour; it is made solid and
        heavy, with a good bottom, and is capable of holding a big cherry
        branch without up-setting. Its very roughness shows off by contrast
        the delicate flowers it holds. With just such rough material as we
        use in the making of drain-tiles and molasses jugs, the Japanese make
        the most fascinating and appropriate flower-vases; but their potters
        are artists, and, alas! ours are not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this connection
        it is interesting to note that in our country, artists, and others
        having artistic tastes, have always recognized the importance of
        observing proper contrasts between flowers and their holders, and
        until within a very few years have been forced, for want of better
        receptacles, to arrange flowers in German pottery-mugs, Chinese
        ginger-jars, and the like. Though these vessels were certainly
        inappropriate enough, the flowers looked vastly prettier in them than
        they ever could in the frightful wares designed expressly to hold
        them, made by American and European manufacturers. What a satire on
        our art industries,‚Äîa despairing resort to beer-mugs, ginger-jars and
        blacking-pots, for suitable flower-vases! Who does not recall, indeed
        cannot see to-day on the shelves of most <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúcrockery shops,‚Äù</span> a hideous battalion of garish
        porcelain and iniquitous parian vases, besides other multitudinous
        evidences of utter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
        305]</span> ignorance as to what a flower-vase should be, in the
        discordantly colored and decorated glass receptacles designed to hold
        these daintiest bits of Nature's handiwork?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
        flower-vase made to stand on the floor, the Japanese have others
        which are made to hang from a hook,‚Äîgenerally from the post or
        partition that divides the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> from its companion recess,
        or sometimes from a corner-post. When a permanent partition occurs in
        a room, it is quite proper to hang the vase from the middle post. In
        all these cases it is hung midway between the floor and the ceiling.
        These hanging flower-vases are infinite in form and design, and are
        made of pottery, bronze, bamboo, or wood. Those made of pottery and
        bronze may be in the form of simple tubes; often, however, natural
        forms are represented,‚Äîsuch as fishes, insects, sections of bamboo,
        and the like.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese are
        fond of ancient objects, and jars which have been dug up are often
        mutilated, at least for the antiquarian, by having rings inserted in
        their sides so that they may be hung up for flower-holders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious form of
        holder is made out of a rugged knot of wood. Any quaint and abnormal
        growth of wood, in which an opening can be made big enough to
        accommodate a section of bamboo to hold the water, is used for a
        flower-vase. Such an object will be decorated with tiny bronze ants,
        a silver spider's web with bronze spider, and pearl wrought in the
        shape of a fungus. These and other singular caprices are worked into
        and upon the wood as ornaments.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very favorite
        form of flower-holder is one made of bamboo. The bamboo tube is

        old pottery. Many of these baskets are quite old, and are highly

        devices are often seen for holding flower-pots. The annexed figure

        shelves upon which the flower-pots are to rest. A hole is made at the
        top so that it may be hung against the wall, and little cleats are
        fastened crosswise to hold long strips of stiff paper, upon which it
        is customary to write stanzas of poetry. These objects are of the

        suspended from above, a common form is a square wooden bucket, or one
        made out of pottery or bronze in imitation of this form. Bamboo cut
        in horizontal forms is also used for suspended flower-holders.
        Indeed, there seems to be no end of curious objects used for this

        sketched at the National Exposition at Tokio in 1877. Its
        construction was very ingenious; three staves of the low bucket were
        continued upward to form portions of three small buckets above, and
        each of these, in turn, contributed a stave to the single bucket that
        crowned the whole. Another form, made by the same contributor thought
        not so symmetrical, was quite as odd.</p>

        braided-straw affairs are made to hold flowers, or rather the bamboo
        segments in which the flowers are kept. These are made in the form of
        insects, fishes, mushrooms, and other natural objects. These are
        mentioned, not that they have a special merit, but to illustrate the
        devices used| by the common people in decorating their homes. Racks
        of wood richly lacquered are also used, from which hanging
        flower-holders are suspended. These objects are rarely seen now, and
        I have never chanced to see one in use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My interest in
        Japanese homes was first aroused by wishing to know precisely what
        use the Japanese made of a class of objects with which I had been
        familiar in the Art Museums and private collections at home;
        furthermore, a study of their houses led me to search for those
        evidences of household decoration which might possibly parallel the
        hanging baskets, corner <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg
        309]</span> brackets, and especially ornaments made of birch bark,
        fungi, moss, shell-work, and the like, with which our humbler homes
        are often garnished. It was delightful to find that the Japanese were
        susceptible to the charms embodied in these bits of Nature, and that
        they too used them in similar decorative ways. At the outset, search
        for an object aside from the bare rooms seemed fruitless enough. At
        first sight these rooms appeared absolutely barren; in passing from
        one room to another one got the idea that the house was to be let.
        Picture to yourself a room with no fire-place and accompanying
        mantel,‚Äîthat shelf of shelves for the support of pretty objects; no
        windows with their convenient interspaces for the suspension of
        pictures or brackets; no table, rarely even cabinets, to hold
        bright-colored bindings and curious bric-a-brac; no side-boards upon
        which to array the rich pottery or glistening porcelain; no chairs,
        desks, or bedsteads, and consequently no opportunity for the display
        of elaborate carvings or rich cloth coverings. Indeed, one might well
        wonder in what way this people displayed their pretty objects for
        household decorations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After studying the
        Japanese home for a while, however, one comes to realize that display
        as such is out of the question with them, and to recognize that a
        severe Quaker-like simplicity is really one of the great charms of a
        Japanese room. Absolute cleanliness and refinement, with very few
        objects in sight upon which the eye may rest contentedly, are the
        main features in household adornment which the Japanese strive after,
        and which they attain with a simplicity and effectiveness that we can
        never hope to reach. Our rooms seem to them like a curiosity shop,
        and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äústuffy‚Äù</span> to the last degree. Such
        a maze of vases, pictures, plaques, bronzes, with shelves, brackets,
        cabinets, and tables loaded down with bric-a-brac, is quite enough to
        drive a Japanese frantic. We parade in the most unreasoning manner
        every object of this nature in our possession; and with the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span> periodical
        recurrence of birthday and Christmas holidays, and the consequent
        influx of new things, the less pretty ones already on parade are
        banished to the chambers above to make room for the new ones; and as
        these in turn get crowded out they rise to the garret, there to be
        providentially broken up by the children, or to be preserved for
        future antiquarians to contemplate, and to ponder over the condition
        of art in this age. Our walls are hung with large fish-plates which
        were intended to hold food; heavy bronzes, which in a Japanese room
        are made to rest solidly on the floor, and to hold great woody
        branches of the plum or cherry with their wealth of blossoms, are
        with us often placed on high shelves or perched in some perilous
        position over the door. The ignorant display is more rarely seen of
        thrusting a piece of statuary into the window, so that the neighbor
        across the way may see it; when a silhouette, cut out of stiff
        pasteboard, would in this position answer all the purposes so far as
        the inmates are concerned. How often we destroy an artist's best
        efforts by exposing his picture against some glaring fresco or
        distracting wall-paper! And still not content with the accumulated
        misery of such a room, we allow the upholsterer and furnisher to
        provide us with a gorgeously framed mirror, from which we may have
        flashed back at us the contents of the room reversed, or, more
        dreadful still, a reverberation of these horrors through opposite
        reflecting surfaces,‚Äîa futile effort of Nature to sicken us of the
        whole thing by endless repetition.<a id="noteref_24" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That we in America
        are not exceptional in these matters of questionable furnishing, one
        may learn by listening to an English authority on this subject,‚Äîone
        who has done more than any other writer in calling attention not only
        to violations of true taste in household adornment, but who points
        out in a most rational way the correct paths to follow, not only to
        avoid that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span>
        which is offensive and pretentious, but to arrive at better methods
        and truer principles in matters of taste. We refer to Charles L.
        Eastlake and his timely work entitled <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHints
        on Household Taste.‚Äù</span> In his animadversions on the commonplace
        taste shown in the furnishing of English houses, he says <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúit pervades and vitiates the judgment by which we are
        accustomed to select and approve the objects of every-day use which
        we see around us. It crosses our path in the Brussels carpet of our
        drawing-room; it is about our bed in the shape of gaudy chintz; it
        compels us to rest on chairs, and to sit at tables which are designed
        in accordance with the worst principles of construction, and invested
        with shapes confessedly unpicturesque. It sends us metal-work from
        Birmingham, which is as vulgar in form as it is flimsy in execution.
        It decorates the finest modern porcelain with the most objectionable
        character of ornament. It lines our walls with silly representations
        of vegetable life, or with a mass of uninteresting diaper. It bids
        us, in short, furnish our houses after the same fashion as we dress
        ourselves,‚Äîand that is with no more sense of real beauty than if art
        were a dead letter.‚Äù</span> Let us contrast our tastes in these
        matters with those of the Japanese, and perhaps profit by the
        lesson.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the previous
        chapters sufficient details have been given for one to grasp the
        structural features of a Japanese room. Let us now observe that the
        general tone and color of a Japanese apartment are subdued. Its
        atmosphere is restful; and only after one has sat on the mats for
        some time do the unostentatious fittings of the apartment attract
        one's notice. The papers of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fusuma</span></em> of neutral tints; the
        plastered surfaces, when they occur equally tinted in similar tones,
        warm browns and stone-colors predominating; the cedar-board ceiling,
        with the rich color of that wood; the wood-work everywhere modestly
        conspicuous, and always presenting the natural colors <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span> undefiled by the painter's
        miseries,‚Äîthese all combine to render the room quiet and refined to
        the last degree. The floor in bright contrast is covered with its
        cool straw matting,‚Äîa uniform bright surface set off by the
        rectangular black borders of the mats. It is such an infinite comfort
        to find throughout the length and breadth of that Empire the floors
        covered with the unobtrusive straw matting. Monotonous some would
        think: yes, it has the monotony of fresh air and of pure water. Such
        a room requires but little adornment in the shape of extraneous
        objects; indeed, there are but few places where such objects can be
        placed. But observe, that while in our rooms one is at liberty to
        cover his wall with pictures without the slightest regard to light or
        effect, the Japanese room has a recess clean and free from the floor
        to the hooded partition that spans it above, and this recess is
        placed at right angles to the source of light; furthermor it is
        exalted as the place of highest honor in the room‚Äîand here, and here
        alone, hangs the picture. Not a varnished affair, to see which one
        has to perambulate the apartment with head awry to get a vantage
        point of vision, but a picture which may be seen in its proper light
        from any point of the room. In the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em>
        there is usually but one picture exposed,‚Äîthough, as we have seen,
        this recess may be wide enough to accommodate a set of two or
        three.</p>

        a space say of eighteen inches or more, according to the height of
        the room; and here may sometimes be seen a long narrow <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span> picture, framed in a narrow
        wood-border, or secured to a flat frame, which is concealed by the
        paper or brocade that borders the picture. This picture tips forward
        at a considerable angle, and is supported on two iron hooks. In order
        that the edge of the frame may not be scarred by the iron, it is
        customary to interpose triangular red-crape cushions. A bamboo
        support is often substituted for the iron hooks, as shown in the
        sketch (<a href="#myfig298" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 298</span></a>). The picture may be a landscape,
        or a spray of flowers; but more often it consists of a few Chinese
        characters embodying some bit of poetry, moral precept, or
        sentiment,‚Äîand usually the characters have been written by some poet,
        scholar, or other distinguished man. The square wooden post which
        comes in the middle of a partition between two corners of the room
        may be adorned by a long, narrow, and thin strip of cedar the width
        of the post, upon which is painted a picture of some kind. This
        strip, instead of being of wood, may be of silk and brocade, like a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        so that after one side has done duty for awhile the other side is
        exposed. The wood is usually of dark cedar evenly grained, and the
        sketch is painted directly on the wood. <a href="#myfig299" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The decoration for
        these objects is very skilfully treated by the artist; and while it
        might bother our artists to know what subject to select for a picture
        on so awkward and limited surface, it offers no trouble to the
        Japanese decorator. He simply takes a vertical slice out of some good
        subject, as one might get a glimpse of Nature through a slightly open
        door,‚Äîand imagination is left to supply the rest. These objects find
        their way to our markets, but the bright color used in their
        decoration show that they have been painted for the masses in this
        country. The post upon which this kind of picture is hung, as well as
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">toko-bashira,</span></em> may also adorned with
        a hanging flower-holder such as has already been described.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Japanese may
        have a famous collection of pictures, yet these are stowed away in
        his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kura,</span></em> with the exception of the one
        exposed in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma.</span></em> If he is a man of taste,
        he changes the picture from time to time according to the season, the
        character of his guests, or for special occasions. In one house where
        I was a guest for a few days the picture was changed every day. A
        picture may do duty for a few weeks or months, when it is carefully
        rolled up, stowed away in its silk covering and box, and another one
        is unrolled. In this way a picture never becomes monotonous. The
        listless and indifferent way in which an American will often regard
        his own pictures when showing them to a friend, indicates that his
        pictures have been so long on his walls that they no longer arouse
        any attention or delight. It is true, one never wearies in
        contemplating the work of the great masters; but one should remember
        that all pictures are not masterpieces, and that by constant exposure
        the effect of a picture becomes seriously impaired. The way in which
        pictures with us are crowded on the walls,‚Äîmany of them of necessity
        in the worst possible light, or no light at all when the windows are
        muffled with heavy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
        315]</span> curtains,‚Äîshows that the main interest centres in their
        embossed gilt frames, which are conspicuous in all lights. The
        principle of constant exposure is certainly wrong; a good picture is
        all the more enjoyable if it is not forever staring one in the face.
        Who wants to contemplate a burning tropical sunset on a full stomach,
        or a drizzling northern mist on an empty one? And yet these are the
        experiences which we are often compelled to endure. Why not modify
        our rooms, and have a bay or recess,‚Äîan alcove in the best possible
        light,‚Äîin which one or two good pictures may be properly hung, with
        fitting accompaniments in the way of a few flowers, or a bit of
        pottery or bronze? We have never modified the interior arrangement of
        our house in the slightest degree from the time when it was shaped in
        the most economical way as a shelter in which to eat, sleep, and
        die,‚Äîa rectangular kennel, with necessary holes for light, and
        necessary holes to get in and out by. At the same time, its inmates
        were saturated with a religion so austere and sombre that the
        possession of a picture was for a long time looked upon as savoring
        of worldliness and vanity, unless, indeed, the subject suggested the
        other world by a vision of hexapodous angels, or of the transient
        resting-place to that world in the guise of a tombstone and willows,
        or an immediate departure thereto in the shape of a death-bed
        scene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Japanese
        all collections of pottery and other bric-a-brac are, in the same way
        as the pictures, carefully enclosed in brocade bags and boxes, and
        stowed away to be unpacked only when appreciative friends come to the
        house; and then the host enjoys them with equal delight. Aside from
        the heightened enjoyment sure to be evoked by the Japanese method,
        one is spared an infinite amount of chagrin and misery in having an
        unsophisticated friend become enthusiastic over the wrong thing, or
        mistake a rare etching of Dante for a North American savage, or
        manifest a thrill of delight <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page316">[pg 316]</span> over an object because he learns
        incidentally that its value corresponds with his yearly grocery
        bill.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing is more
        striking in a Japanese room than the harmonies and contrasts between
        the colors of the various objects and the room itself. Between the
        picture and the brocades with which it is mounted, and the quiet and
        subdued color of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma</span></em> in which it is hung, there
        is always the most refined harmony, and such a background for the
        delicious and healthy contrasts of color when a spray of bright
        cherry blossoms enlivens the quiet tones of this honored place! The
        general tone of the room sets off to perfection the simplest spray of
        flowers, a quiet picture, a rough bit of pottery or an old bronze;
        and at the same time a costly and magnificent piece of gold lacquer
        blazes out like a gem from these simple surroundings,‚Äîand yet the
        harmony is not disturbed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is an
        interesting fact that the efforts at harmonious and decorative
        effects which have been made by famous artists and decorators in this
        country and in England have been strongly imbued by the Japanese
        spirit, and every success attained is a confirmation of the
        correctness of Japanese taste. Wall-papers are now more quiet and
        unobtrusive; the merit of simplicity and reserve where it belongs,
        and a fitness everywhere, are becoming more widely recognized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is rare to see
        cabinets or conveniences for the display of bric-a-brac in a Japanese
        house, though sometimes a lacquer-stand with a few shelves may be
        seen,‚Äîand on this may be displayed a number of objects consisting of
        ancient pottery, some stone implements, a fossil, old coins, or a few
        water-worn fragments of rock brought from China, and mounted on dark
        wood stands. The Japanese are great collectors of autographs, coins,
        brocades, metal-work, and many other groups of objects; but these are
        rarely exposed. In regard to objects in the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em>
        I have seen in different <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em> variously displayed,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span> natural
        fragments of quartz, crystal spheres, curious water-worn stones,
        coral, old bronze, as well as the customary vase for flowers or the
        incense-burner. These various objects are usually, but not always,
        supported on a lacquer-stand. In the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigai-dana</span></em> I have also noticed the
        sword-rack, lacquer writing-box, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maki-mono,</span></em>
        and books; and when I was guilty of the impertinence of peeking into
        the cupboards, I have seen there a few boxes containing pottery,
        pictures, and the like,‚Äîthough, as before remarked, such things are
        usually kept in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
        lacquer cabinets, there may be seen in the houses of the higher class
        an article of furniture consisting of a few deep shelves, with
        portions of the shelves closed, forming little cupboards. Such a
        cabinet is used to hold writing-paper, toilet articles, trays for
        flowers, and miscellaneous objects for use and ornament. These cases
        are often beautifully lacquered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usual form of
        writing-desk consists of a low stool not over a foot in height, with
        plain side-pieces or legs for support, sometimes having shallow
        drawers; and this is about the only piece of furniture that would
        parallel our table. The illustration (<a href="#myfig300" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 300</span></a>) shows
        one of these tables, upon which may be seen the paper, ink-stone,
        brush, and brush-rest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cities and
        large villages the people stand in constant fear of conflagrations.
        Almost every month they are reminded of the instability of the ground
        they rest upon by tremors and slight shocks, which may be the
        precursors of destructive earthquakes, usually accompanied by
        conflagrations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span>
        infinitely more disastrous. Allusion has been made to the little
        portable engines with which houses are furnished. In the city house
        one may notice a little platform or staging with hand-rail erected on
        the ridge of the roof (<a href="#myfig301" class=
        "tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">fig. 301</span></a>); a
        ladder or flight of steps leads to this staging, and on alarms of
        fire anxious faces may be seen peering from these lookouts in the
        direction of the burning buildings. It is usual to have resting on
        the platform a huge bucket or half barrel filled with water, and near
        by a long-handled brush; and this is used to sprinkle water on places
        threatened by the sparks and fire-brands, which often fill the air in
        times of great conflagrations.</p>

        doors of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In drawing to a
        close this description of Japanese homes and their surroundings, I
        have to regret that neither time, strength, nor opportunity enabled
        me to make it more complete by a description, accompanied by
        sketches, of the residences of the highest classes in Japan. Indeed,
        it is a question whether any of the old residences of the Daimios
        remain in the condition in which they were twenty years ago, or
        before the Revolution. Even where the buildings remain, as in the
        castles of Nagoya and Kumamoto, busy clerks and secretaries are seen
        sitting in chairs and writing at tables in foreign style; and though
        in some cases the beautifully decorated <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma,</span></em>
        with the elaborately carved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ramma</span></em> and rich wood-ceiling are
        still preserved,‚Äîas in the castle of Nagoya, as well as in many
        others doubtless,‚Äîthe introduction of varnished furniture and
        gaudy-colored foreign carpets in some of the apartments has brought
        sad discord into the former harmonies of the place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Tokio a number
        of former Daimios have built houses in foreign style, though these
        somehow or other usually lack the peculiar comforts of our homes. Why
        a Japanese should build a house in foreign style was somewhat of a
        puzzle to me, until I saw the character of their homes and the manner
        in which a foreigner in some cases was likely to behave on entering a
        Japanese house. If he did not walk into it with his boots on, he was
        sure to be seen stalking about in his stockinged <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span> feet, bumping his head at
        intervals against the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kamoi,</span></em> or burning holes in the mats
        in his clumsy attempts to pick up coals from the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hibachi,</span></em>
        with which to light his cigar. Not being able to sit on the mats
        properly, he sprawls about in attitudes confessedly as rude as if a
        Japanese in our apartments were to perch his legs on the table. If he
        will not take off his boots, he possibly finds his way to the garden,
        where he wanders about, indenting the paths with his boot-heels or
        leaving scars on the verandah, possibly washing his hands in the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch≈çdzu-bachi,</span></em> and generally making
        himself the cause of much discomfort to the inmates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a happy
        idea when those Japanese who from their prominence in the affairs of
        the country were compelled to entertain the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúforeign barbarian‚Äù</span> conceived the idea of erecting
        a cage in foreign fashion to hold temporarily the menageries which
        they were often compelled to receive. Seriously, however, the
        inelastic character of most foreigners, and their inability to adapt
        themselves to their surroundings have rendered the erection of
        buildings in foreign style for their entertainment not only a
        convenience but an absolute necessity. It must be admitted that for
        the activities of business especially, the foreign style of office
        and shop is not only more convenient but unquestionably superior.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The former Daimio
        of Chikuzen was one of the first, I believe, to build a house in
        foreign style in Tokio, and this building is a good typical example
        of an American two-story house. Attached, however, to this house is a
        wing containing a number of rooms in native style. <a href=
        "#myfig123" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="color: blue">Fig.
        123</span></a> (page 142) shows one of these rooms. The former Daimio
        of Hizen also lives in a foreign house, and there are many houses in
        Tokio built by Japanese after foreign plans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an earlier
        portion of this work an allusion was made to the absence of those
        architectural monuments which are so <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page321">[pg 321]</span> characteristic of European countries. The
        castles of the Daimios, which are lofty and imposing structures, have
        already been referred to. There are fortresses also of great extent
        and solidity,‚Äînotably the one at Osaka, erected by Hideyoshi on an
        eminence near the city; and though the wooden structures formerly
        surmounting the walls were destroyed by Iyeyas≈≠ in 1615, the stone
        battlements as they stand to-day must be considered as among the
        marvels of engineering skill, and the colossal masses of rock seem
        all the more colossal after one has become familiar with the tiny and
        perishable dwellings of the country. In the walls of this fortress
        are single blocks of stone‚Äîat great heights, too, above the
        surrounding level of the region‚Äîmeasuring in some cases from thirty
        to thirty-six feet in length, and at least fifteen feet in height.
        These huge blocks have been transported long distances from the
        mountains many miles away from the city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Attention is
        called to the existence of these remarkable monuments as an evidence
        that the Japanese are quite competent to erect such buildings, if the
        national taste had inclined them in that way. So far as I know, a
        national impulse has never led the Japanese to commemorate great
        deeds in the nation's life by enduring monuments of stone. The reason
        may be that the plucky little nation has always been successful in
        repelling invasion; and a peculiar quality in their temperament has
        prevented them from perpetuating in a public way, either by monuments
        or by the naming of streets and bridges, the memories of victories
        won by one section of the country over another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rev. W. E.

        noticing the almost total absence of the names of great victories or

        capital of a nation finally united in peaceful union any name that
        would be a constant source of humiliation, that would keep alive
        bitter memories, or that would irritate freshly-healed wounds. The
        anomalous absence of such names proves at once the sagacity of
        Iyeyas≈≠, and is another witness to the oft-repeated policy used by
        the Japanese in treating their enemies,‚Äîthat is, conquer them by
        kindness and conciliation.‚Äù</span></p>

        and Alta√Øc, and it if even precedes by at least a century the most
        ancient extant literary compositions of non-Aryan India.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The allusions to
        house-structure in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki,‚Äù</span>
        though brief, are suggestive, and carry us back without question to
        the condition of the Japanese house in the seventh and eighth
        centuries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Satow, in his
        translation of the Rituals, says that the period when this service
        was first instituted was certainly before the tenth century, and
        probably earlier. From these records he ascertains that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúthe palace of the Japanese sovereign was a wooden hut,
        with its pillars planted in the ground, instead of being erected upon
        broad, flat stones, as in modern buildings. The whole frame-work,
        consisting of posts, beams, rafters, door-posts, and window-frames,
        was tied together with cords, made by twisting the long fibrous stems
        of climbing plants,‚Äîsuch as Pueraria Thunbergiana <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">(kuzu)</span></em>
        and Wistaria Sinensis <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">(fuji).</span></em> The floor must have been low
        down, so that the occupants of the building, as they squatted or lay
        on their mats, were exposed to the stealthy attacks of venomous
        snakes, which were probably far more numerous in the earliest ages
        when the country was for the most part uncultivated than at the
        present day‚Ä¶There seems some reason to think that the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yuka,</span></em>
        here translated <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòfloor,‚Äô</span> was
        originally nothing but a couch which ran around the sides of the hut,
        the rest of the space being simply a mud-floor; and that the size of
        the couch was gradually increased until it occupied the whole
        interior. The rafters projected upward beyond the ridge-pole,
        crossing each other as is seen in the roofs of modern Shin-tau
        temples, whether their architecture be in conformity with early
        traditions (in which case all the rafters are so crossed), or
        modified <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span> in
        accordance with more advanced principles of construction, and the
        crossed rafters retained only as ornaments at the two ends of the
        ridge. The roof was thatched, and perhaps had a gable at each end,
        with a hole to allow the smoke of the wood-fire to escape,‚Äîso that it
        was possible for birds flying in and perching on the beams overhead,
        to defile the food, or the fire with which it was cooked.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki‚Äù</span> we learn that even in those
        early days the house was sufficiently differentiated to present forms
        referred to as temples or palaces, houses of the people, storehouses,
        and rude huts. That the temples or palaces were more than rude huts
        is shown by references to the verandah, the great roof, stout
        pillars, and high cross-beams. They were at least two stories high,
        as we read of people gazing from an upper story. The peasants were
        not allowed to build a house with a raised roof frame,‚Äîthat is, a
        roof the upper portion or ridge of which was raised above the roof
        proper, and having a different structure. This indicates the
        existence at that time of different kinds of roofs, or ridges.
        Fire-places were in the middle of the floor, and the smoke-outlet was
        in the gable end of the roof protected by a lattice,‚Äîas seen in the
        Japanese country houses of to-day. The posts or pillars of the house
        were buried deep in the ground, and not, as in the present house,
        resting on a stone foundation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The allusions in
        the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki,‚Äù</span> where it says,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúand if thou goest in a boat along that road
        there will appear a palace built like fish-scales,‚Äù</span> and again,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe ill-omened crew were shattered like
        tiles,‚Äù</span> show the existence of tiles at that time. A curious
        reference is also made to using cormorants' feathers for thatch.
        There were front doors and back doors, doors to be raised, and
        windows and openings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is mentioned
        that through the awkwardness of the carpenter the farther
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfin‚Äù</span> of the great roof is bent down
        at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span>
        corner,‚Äîprobably indicating wide over-hanging eaves, the corners of
        which might easily be called <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfins.‚Äù</span>
        Within the house were mats of sedge, skin, and silk, and ornamental
        screens protect the sleepers from draughts of air.<a id="noteref_30"
        name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> The
        castles had back gates, side gates, and other gates. Some of these
        gates, at least, had a roof-like structure above, as we read in the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki,‚Äù</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúCome under the metal gate; we will stand till the rain
        stops.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fences are also
        alluded to. The latrine is mentioned several times as being away from
        the house, and having been placed over running water,‚Äî<span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúwhence doubtless the name <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kaha-ya;</span></em>
        that is, river-house.‚Äù</span> This feature is specially
        characteristic of the latrine, from Siam to Java. This suggestion of
        early finities with the Malay people is seen in an ancient Japanese
        Classic, dating from the tenth century, entitled <em class=

        we read, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNow, in olden days the people dwelt

        In the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki‚Äù</span>, we also read,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThey made in the middle of the river Hi a
        black plaited bridge, and respectfully offered a temporary palace to
        dwell in.‚Äù</span> The translator says the significance of this
        passage is: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThey built as a temporary abode
        for the prince a house in the river Hi (whether with its foundations
        actually in the water or on an island is left undetermined),
        connecting it with the main-land by a bridge made of branches of
        trees; twisted together, and with their bark left on them (this is
        here the import of the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúKojiki‚Äù</span> mentions a two-forked boat: may this be
        some kind of a catamaran? Mention is also made of eating from
        leaf-platters: this is a marked Malay feature.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These various
        statements‚Äîparticularly those concerning the latrine, and building
        houses over the water‚Äîare significant indications of the marked
        southern affinities of the Japanese. Other features of similarity
        with southern people are seen in the general structure of the
        house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ancient
        Japanese Rituals, Mr. Satow finds that the rafters projected upward
        beyond the ridge-pole of the roof crossing each other,‚Äîas is seen in
        the roofs of modern Shin-t≈ç temples. A curious feature is often seen
        on the gable ends of the roofs of the Malay houses near Singapore,
        consisting of projecting pieces crossing each other at the two ends
        of the roof; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span>
        and these are ornamented by being cut in odd sweeps and curves
        (<a href="#myfig303" class="tei tei-ref"><span style=
        "color: blue">fig. 303</span></a>). Survivals of these crossing
        rafters are seen in the modern Japanese dwelling; that is, if we are
        to regard as such the wooden X's which straddle the roof at
        intervals, as shown in figs. 45 (page 62) and 85 (page 98). A
        precisely similar feature is seen on the roofs of houses along the
        river approaching Saigon, and on the road leading from Saigon to
        Cholon, in Anam (fig. 304).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        customary to regard the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em> or bed-place, in the
        Japanese house as being derived from the Aino house. The suggestion
        of such a derivation seems to me to have no foundation. In the Aino
        house the solid ground is the floor; sometimes, but not always, a
        rush mat is spread along the side of the fireplace, which is in the
        centre of the hut. The slightest attention to comfort would lead the
        Ainos to erect a platform of boards,‚Äîand such a platform is generally
        found next to the wall in the Aino hut. This platform not only serves
        as a sleeping-place, but holds also boxes and household goods, as
        well as such objects as were not suspended to the sides of the houses
        or from poles stretched across. In no case did I see a raised
        platform protected by a partition, or one utilized solely for a
        sleeping-place. If it were safe to venture upon any conjecture as to
        the origin of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tokonoma,</span></em> or if external
        resemblances had any weight in affinities of structure, one might see
        the prototype of this feature in the Malay <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page330">[pg 330]</span> house. In the Malay villages near
        Singapore, one may see not only a slightly raised place for the bed
        exclusively, but also a narrow partition jutting out from the side of
        the wall, not unlike that which separates the <em class=

        various relations pointed out between the Japanese house and similar
        features in the Malay house are of any weight or not, they must be
        recognized in any attempt to trace the origin of those features in
        house-structure which have originated outside of Japan. From all that
        we can gather relating to the ancient house of the Japanese, it would
        seem that certain important resemblances must be sought for among the
        southern nations of Anam, Cochin China, and particularly those of the
        Malay peninsula.</p>

        Shin-t≈ç temples in Japan in point of sanctity, though not the most
        ancient,‚Äù</span> has some interesting matter concerning the character
        of the ancient house. He says:‚Äî</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúJapanese antiquarians tell us that in early times,
        before carpenters' tools had been invented, the dwellings of the
        people who inhabited these islands were constructed of young trees
        with the bark on, fastened together with ropes made of the rush
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">(suge,</span></em>‚ÄîScirpus maritimus), or
        perhaps with the tough shoots of the wistaria <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">(fuji),</span></em>
        and thatched with the grass called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kaya.</span></em> In
        modern buildings the uprights of a house stand upon large stones laid
        on the surface of the earth; but this precaution against decay had
        not occurred to the ancients, who planted the uprights in holes dug
        in the ground.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ground-plan of
        the hut was oblong, with four corner uprights, and one in the middle
        of each of the four sides,‚Äîthose in the sides which formed the ends
        being long enough to support the ridge-pole. Other trees were
        fastened horizontally from corner to corner,‚Äîone set near the ground,
        one near the top, and one set on the top, the latter of which formed
        what we call the wall-plates. Two large rafters, whose upper ends
        crossed each other, were laid from the wall-plates to the heads of
        the taller uprights. The ridge-pole rested in the fork formed by the
        upper ends of the rafters crossing each other. Horizontal poles were
        then laid along each slope of the roof, one pair being fastened close
        up to the exterior angle of the fork. The rafters were slender poles,
        or bamboos, passed over the ridge-pole and fastened down on each end
        to the wall-plates. Next followed the process of putting on the
        thatch. In order to keep this in its place, two trees were laid along
        the top resting in the forks; and across these two trees were placed
        short logs at equal distances, which being fastened to the poles in
        the exterior angle of the forks by ropes passed through the thatch,
        bound the ridge of the roof firmly together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe walls and doors were constructed of rough matting.
        It is evident that some tool must have been used to cut the trees to
        the required length; and for this purpose a sharpened stone was
        probably employed. Such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg
        332]</span> stone implements have been found imbedded in the earth in
        various parts of Japan, in company with stone arrow-heads and clubs.
        Specimens of the ancient style of building may even yet be seen in
        remote parts of the country,‚Äînot perhaps so much in the habitations
        of the peasantry, as in sheds erected to serve a temporary
        purpose.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe architecture of the Shin-t≈ç temples is derived from
        the primeval hut, with more or less modification in proportion to the
        influence of Buddhism in each particular case. Those of the purest
        style retain the thatched roof; others are covered with the thick
        shingling called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hiwada-buki,</span></em> while others have tiled
        and even coppered roofs. The projecting ends of the rafters called
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chigi</span></em> have been somewhat lengthened,
        and carved more or less elaborately. At the new temple at Kudanzaka
        in Yedo they are shown in the proper position, projecting from the
        inside of the shingling; but in the majority of cases they merely
        consist of two pieces of wood in the form of the letter X, which rest
        on the ridge of the roof like a pack-saddle on a horse's back, to
        make use of a Japanese writer's comparison. The logs which kept the
        two trees laid on the ridge in their place have taken the form of
        short cylindrical pieces of timber tapering towards each extremity,
        which have been compared by foreigners to cigars. In Japanese they
        are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">katsuo-gi,</span></em> from their resemblance to
        the pieces of dried bonito sold under the name of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">katsuo-bushi.</span></em> The two trees laid
        along the roof over the thatch are represented by a single beam,
        called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Munaosae,</span></em> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äòroof-presser.‚Äô</span> Planking has taken the place of
        the mats with which the sides of the building were originally closed,
        and the entrance is closed by a pair of folding doors, turning not on
        hinges, but on what are, I believe, technically called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äòjournals.‚Äô</span> The primeval hut had no flooring; but
        we find that the shrine has a wooden floor raised some feet above the
        ground, which arrangement necessitates a sort of balcony all round,
        and a flight of steps up to the entrance. The transformation is
        completed in some cases by the addition of a quantity of ornamental
        metal-work in brass.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Coming down to
        somewhat later times, we find a charming bit of description of the

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tosa
        Nikki,</span></em> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTosa Diary,‚Äù</span>
        translated by W. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
        333]</span> G. Aston. This Diary was written in the middle of the
        tenth century, and is the record of a court noble who lived in Kioto,
        but who was absent from his home five or six years as Prefect of
        Tosa. The Diary was a record of his journey home, and the first entry
        in it was in the fourth year of Shohei, which according to our
        reckoning must have been in the early part of 935 A.D., or nearly one
        thousand years ago. During his absence from home, news had come to
        him of the death of his little daughter nine years old; and he says,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWith the joyful thought, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄòHome to Kioto!‚Äô</span> there mingles the bitter
        reflection that there is one who never will return.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The journey home
        was mostly by sea; and finally, having entered the Osaka River, and
        spent several days in struggling against the strong current, he
        reaches Yamazaki, from which place he starts for Kioto. He expresses
        great delight in recognizing the old familiar landmarks as he rides
        along. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe mentions the children's playthings
        and sweetmeats in the shops as looking exactly as when he went away,
        and wonders whether he will find as little change in the hearts of
        his friends. He had purposely left Yamazaki in the evening in order
        that it might be night when he reached his own dwelling.‚Äù</span> Mr.
        Aston translates his account of the state in which he found it:‚Äî</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe moon was shining brightly when I reached my house
        and entered the gate, so that its condition was plainly to be seen.
        It was decayed and ruined beyond all description,‚Äîworse even than I
        had been told. The house<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=
        "#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> of the
        man in whose charge I left it was in an equally dilapidated
        condition. The fence between the two houses had been broken down, so
        that both seemed but one, and he appeared to have fulfilled his
        charge by looking in through the gaps. And yet I had supplied him, by
        every opportunity, with the means of keeping it in repair. To-night,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span> however, I
        would not allow him to be told this in an angry tone, but in spite of
        my vexation offered him an acknowledgment for his trouble. There was
        in one place something like a pond, where water had collected in a
        hollow, by the side of which grew a fir-tree. It had lost half its
        branches, and looked as if a thousand years had passed during the
        five or six years of my absence. Younger trees had grown up round it,
        and the whole place was in a most neglectful condition, so that every
        a one said that it was pitiful to see. Among other sad thoughts that
        rose spontaneously to my mind was the memory‚Äîah! how sorrowful!‚Äîof
        one who was born in this house, but who did not return here along
        with me. My fellow-passengers were chatting merrily with their
        children in their arms, but I meanwhile, still unable to contain my
        grief, privately repeated these lines to one who knew my
        heart.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this pathetic
        account one gets a glimpse of the house as it appeared nearly a
        thousand years ago. The broken fence between the houses; the gateway,
        probably a conspicuous structure then as it is to-day, in a
        dilapidated condition; and the neglected garden with a tangle of
        young trees growing up,‚Äîall show the existence in those early days of
        features similar to those which exist to-day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
        house development in Japan, if it should ever be revealed, will
        probably show a slow but steady progress from the rude hut of the
        past to the curious and artistic house of to-day,‚Äîa house as
        thoroughly a product of Japan as is that of the Chinese, Korean, or
        Malay a product of those respective peoples, and differing from all
        quite as much as they differ from one another. A few features have
        been introduced from abroad, but these have been trifling as compared
        to the wholesale imitation of foreign styles of architecture by our
        ancestors, the English; and until within a few years we have followed
        England's example in perpetuating the legacy it left us, in the shape
        of badly imitated foreign architecture, classical and otherwise. As a
        result, we have scattered over the land, among a few public buildings
        of good taste, a countless <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
        335]</span> number of ill-proportioned, ugly, and entirely
        inappropriate buildings for public use. Had the exuberant fancies of
        the village architect revelled in woodsheds or one-storied buildings,
        the harm would have been trifling; but the desire for pretentious
        show, which seems to characterize the average American, has led to
        the erection of these architectural horrors on the most conspicuous
        sites,‚Äîand thus the public taste is vitiated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Japanese,
        while developing an original type of house, have adopted the
        serviceable tile from Korea, and probably also the economical
        transverse framing and vertical struts from China, and bits of temple
        architecture for external adornments. As to their temple
        architecture, which came in with one of their religions, they had the
        good sense to leave it comparatively as it was brought to them.
        Indeed, the temples seem in perfect harmony with the country and its
        people. What shall we say, however, to the taste displayed by the
        English, who in the most servile manner have copied foreign styles of
        architecture utterly unsuited to their climate and people! In the
        space of an English block one may see not only Grecian, Roman,
        Italian, and Egyptian, as well as other styles of architecture, but
        audaciously attempted crosses between some of these; and the
        resulting hybrids have in consequence rendered the modern English
        town the most unpicturesque muddle of buildings in Christendom
        outside our own country.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=

        HOUSE.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having got a
        glimpse, and a slight glimpse only, of the ancient house in Japan, it
        may be of interest to consider briefly the character of the house in
        neighboring islands forming part of the Japanese Empire, and also of
        the house in that country which comes nearest to Japan (Korea), and
        from which country in the past there have been many both peaceful and
        compulsory invasions,‚Äîcompulsory in the fact that when Hideyoshi
        returned from Korea, nearly three hundred years ago, after his great
        invasion of that country, he brought back with him to Japan colonies
        of potters and other artisans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ainos of Yezo
        naturally claim our attention first, because it is believed that they
        were the aboriginal people of Japan proper, and were afterwards
        displaced by the Japanese,‚Äîa displacement similar to that of our
        North American savages by the English colonists. Whether the Ainos
        are autochthonous or not, will not be discussed here. That they are a
        savage race, without written language,‚Äîa race which formerly occupied
        the northern part of the main island of Japan, and were gradually
        forced back to Yezo, where they still live in scattered
        communities,‚Äîare facts which are unquestionable. How far the Aino
        house to-day represents the ancient Aino house, and how <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span> many features of the
        Japanese house are engrafted upon it, are points difficult to
        determine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ainos that I
        saw in the Ishikari valley, on the west coast of Yezo, and from
        Shiraoi south on the east coast, all spoke Japanese, ate out of
        lacquer bowls, used chop-sticks, smoked small pipes, drank <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sake,</span></em> and
        within their huts possessed lacquer boxes and other conveniences in
        which to stow away their clothing, which had probably been given them
        in past times by the Japanese, and which were heirlooms. On the other
        hand, they retained their own language, their long, narrow dug-out;
        used the small bow, the poisoned arrow, and had an arrow-release of
        their own; adhered to their ancestral forms of worship and their
        peculiar methods of design, and were quite as persistent in clinging
        to many of their customs as are our own Western tribes of Indians.
        That they are susceptible to change is seen in the presence of a
        young Aino at the normal school in Tokio, from whom I derived some
        interesting facts concerning archery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Briefly, the Aino
        house, as I saw it, consists of a rude frame-work of timber
        supporting a thatched roof; the walls being <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page338">[pg 338]</span> made up of reeds and rush interwoven
        with stiffer cross-pieces. Within, there is a single room the
        dimensions of the house. In most houses there is an L, in which is
        the doorway, which may in some cases be covered with a rude porch.
        The thatched roof is well made and quite picturesque, differing
        somewhat in form from any thatched roof among the Japanese,‚Äîthough in
        Yamato, as already mentioned, I saw features in the slope of the roof
        quite similar to those shown in some of the Aino roofs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Entering the house
        by the low door, one comes into a room so dark that it is with
        difficulty one can see anything. The inmates light rolls of
        birch-bark that one may be enabled to see the interior; but every
        appearance of neatness and picturesqueness which the hut presented
        from without vanishes when one gets inside. Beneath one's feet is a
        hard, damp, earth floor; directly above are the blackened and
        soot-covered rafters. Poles supported horizontally from these rafters
        are equally greasy and blackened, and pervading the darkness is a
        dirty and strong fishy odor. In the middle of the floor, and
        occupying considerable space, is a square area,‚Äîthe fireplace. On its
        two sides mats are spread. A pot hangs over the smoke, for there
        appears to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span> be
        but little fire; and at one side is a large bowl containing the
        remains of the last meal, consisting apparently of fish-bones,‚Äîlarge
        sickly-looking bones, the sight of which instantly vitiates one's
        appetite. The smoke, rebuffed at the only opening save the door,‚Äîa
        small square opening close under the low eaves,‚Äîstruggles to escape
        through a small opening in the angle of the roof. On one side of the
        room is a slightly raised floor of boards, upon which are mats,
        lacquer-boxes, bundles of nets, and a miscellaneous assortment of
        objects. Hanging from the rafters and poles are bows, quivers of
        arrows, Japanese daggers mounted on curious wooden tablets inlaid
        with lead, slices of fish and skates' heads in various stages, not of
        decomposition, as the odors would seem to imply, but of smoke
        preservation. Dirt everywhere, and fleas. And in the midst of the
        darkness, smoke, and squalor are the inmates,‚Äîquiet, demure, and
        gentle to the last degree. Figs. 306 and 307 give an idea of the
        appearance of two Aino houses of the better kind, but perhaps cannot
        be taken as a type of the Aino house farther north on the island.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now glance
        at the house of the natives of the Hachij√¥ Islanders, as described by
        Mr. Dickins and Mr. Satow.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href=
        "#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        their communication the following account is taken:‚Äî</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúAs may readily be supposed, there are no shops or inns
        on the island, but fair accommodation for travellers can be obtained
        at the farmers' houses. These are for the most part
        substantially-built cottages of two or three rooms, with a spacious
        kitchen, constructed with the timber of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Quercus
        cuspidata,</span></em> and with plank walls, where on the mainland it
        is usual to have plastered wattles. The roof is invariably of thatch,
        with a very high pitch,‚Äînecessitated, we were told, by the extreme
        dampness of the climate, which renders it desirable to allow as
        little rain as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span>
        possible to soak into the straw. Many of the more prosperous farmers
        have a second building, devoted to the rearing of silkworms, which
        takes its name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">(kaiko-ya)</span></em> from the purpose to which
        it is destined. There are also sheds for cattle, usually consisting
        of a thatched roof resting on walls formed of rough stone-work.
        Lastly, each enclosure possesses a wooden godown, raised some four
        feet from the ground on stout wooden posts, crowned with broad caps,
        to prevent the mice from gaining an entrance. The style resembles
        that of the storehouses constructed by the Ainos and
        Loochooans.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe house and vegetable-garden belonging to it are
        usually surrounded by a stone wall, or rather bank of stones and
        earth, often six feet high, designed to protect the buildings from
        the violent gales which at certain seasons sweep over the island, and
        which, as we learned, frequently do serious injury to the rice-fields
        by the quantity of salt spray which they carry a long distance inland
        from the shore.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this general
        description of the house which incidentally accompanies a very
        interesting sketch of the physical peculiarities of the island, its
        geology, botany, and the customs and dialect of the people, we get no
        idea of the special features the house,‚Äîas to the fireplace or
        bed-place; whether there be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh≈çji</span></em> or ordinary windows, matted
        floor, or any of those details which would render a comparison with
        the Japanese house of value.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Mr. Satow found
        in the language of the Hachij√¥ Islander a number of words which
        appeared to be survivals of archaic Japanese, and also among their
        customs the curious one, which existed up to within very recent
        times, of erecting parturition houses,‚Äîa feature which is alluded to
        in the very earliest records of Japan,‚Äîa minute description of the
        Hachij√¥ house with sketches might possibly lead to some facts of
        interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Loochoo, or
        Riukiu Islands, now known as Okinawa Shima, lie nearly midway between
        the southern part of Japan and the Island of Formosa. The people of
        this group differ <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg
        341]</span> but little from the Japanese,‚Äîtheir language, according
        to Mr. Satow and Mr. Brunton, having in it words that appear obsolete
        in Japan. In many customs there is a curious admixture of Chinese and
        Japanese ways; and Mr. Brunton sees in the Loochooan bridge and other
        structures certain resemblances to Chinese methods.</p>

        tiles of a Chinese fashion, very strong and thick. The buildings in
        which they store their rice are built of wood and thatched with
        straw. They are supported on wooden posts about five feet high, and

          screens of paper. They are built of wood, and present no peculiar
          differences from the Japanese style of</span> <span class=

          "font-size: 90%">construction. The roofs are laid with tiles, which
          however are quite different in shape from the Japanese tiles. Over
          the joint between two concave tiles a convex one is laid, and these
          are all semi-circular in cross sections. The tiles are made at
          Nafa, and are red in color; they appeared of good quality. The
          houses of the poorer classes are of very primitive character. The
          roof is covered with a thick thatch, and is supported by four
          corner uprights about five feet high. The walls consist of sheets
          of a species of netting made of small bamboo, which contain between
          them a thickness of about six inches of straw. This encloses the
          whole sides of the house,‚Äîa width of about two feet being left in
          one side as an entrance. There is no flooring in the houses of any
          description, and there is generally laid over the mud inside a mat,
          on which the inmates lie or sit.</span><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering the
        presence for so many centuries of strong Chinese influence which Mr.
        Brunton sees in the Loochooans, it is rather surprising to find so
        many features of the Japanese house present in their dwellings.
        Indeed, Mr. Brunton goes so far as to say that the Loochooan house
        presents no peculiar differences from the Japanese style of
        construction; and as he has paid special attention to the
        constructive features of Japanese buildings, we must believe that had
        differences existed they would have been noted by him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to me
        that the wide distribution of certain identical features in Japanese
        house-structure, from the extreme north of Japan to the Loochoo
        Islands, is something remarkable. Here is a people who for centuries
        lived almost independent provincial lives, the northern and southern
        provinces speaking different dialects, even the character of the
        people varying, and yet from Awomori in the north to the southernmost
        parts of Satsuma, and even farther south to the Loochoos, the use of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fusuma,
        sh≈çji,</span></em> mats, and thin wood-ceilings seems well-nigh
        universal. The store-houses standing on four posts are referred to in
        the description of the Hachij√¥ Islanders as well as in that of the
        Loochooans as resembling those constructed by the Ainos; yet
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span> these
        resemblances must not be taken as indicating a community of origin,
        but simply as the result of necessity. For travellers in Kamtchatka,
        and farther west, speak of the same kind of store-houses; and farther
        south they may be seen in Singapore and Java,‚Äîin fact, in every
        country town in New England; and indeed all over the United States
        the same kind of storehouse is seen. Probably all over the world a
        store-house on four legs, even to the inverted box or pan on each
        leg, may be found.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the
        courtesy of Percival Lowell, Esq., I am enabled to see advanced
        sheets of his work on Korea, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe
        Land of the Morning Calm;‚Äù</span> and from this valuable work the
        author has permitted me to gather many interesting facts concerning
        the Korean dwellings. The houses are of one story; a flight of two or
        three steps leads to a narrow piazza, or very wide sill, which
        encircles the entire building. The apartment within is only limited
        by the size of the building; in other words, there is only one room
        under the roof. The better class of dwellings, however, consist of
        groups of these buildings. The house is of wood, and rests upon a
        stone foundation. This foundation consists of a series of connecting
        chambers, or flues; and at one side is a large fireplace, or oven, in
        which the fire is built. The products of combustion circulate through
        this labyrinth of chambers, and find egress, not by a chimney, but by
        an outlet on the opposite side. In this way the room above is warmed.
        There are three different types of this oven-like foundation. In the
        best type a single slab of stone is supported by a number of stout
        stone pillars; upon this stone floor is spread a layer of earth, and
        upon this earth is spread oil-paper like a carpet. In another
        arrangement, ridges of earth and small stones run lengthwise from
        front to back; on top of this the same arrangement is made of stone,
        earth, and oil-paper. In the third type, representing a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span> still poorer class, the
        oven and flues are hollowed out of the earth alone. Mr. Lowell
        remarks that the idea is a good one, if it were only accompanied by
        proper ventilation. Unfortunately, he says, the room above is no
        better than a box, in which the occupant is slowly roasted. Another
        disadvantage is experienced in the impossibility of warming a room at
        once. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe room does not even begin
        to get warm until you have passed through an agonizing interval of
        expectancy. Then it takes what seems forever to reach a comfortable
        temperature, passes this brief second of happiness before you have
        had time to realize that it has attained it, and continues mounting
        to unknown degrees in a truly alarming manner, beyond the possibility
        of control.‚Äù</span> This curious and ingenious method of warming
        houses is said to have been introduced from China some one hundred
        and fifty years ago.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A house of the
        highest order is simply a frame-work,‚Äîa roof supported on eight or
        more posts according to the size of the building; and this with a
        foundation represents the only fixed structure. In summer it presents
        a skeleton-like appearance; in winter, however, it appears solid and
        compact, as a series of folding-doors,‚Äîa pair between each two
        posts,‚Äîcloses it completely. These are prettily latticed, open
        outward, and are fastened from within by a hook and knob. By a
        curious arrangement these doors can be removed from their hinges, the
        upper parts only remaining attached, and fastened up by hooks to the
        ceiling. This kind of a house and room is used as a banqueting hall
        and a room for general entertainment. It may be compared to our
        drawing-room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dwelling-rooms are
        constructed on quite a different plan. Instead of continuous doors,
        the sides are composed of permanent walls and doors. The wall is of
        wood, except that in the poorer house it consists of mud. Says Mr.
        Lowell: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn these buildings we have an
        elaborate system of three-fold aperture <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page345">[pg 345]</span> closers,‚Äîa species of three skins, only
        that they are for consecutive, not simultaneous, use. The outer is
        the folding-door above mentioned; the other two are a couple of pairs
        of sliding panels,‚Äîthe survivors in Korea of the once common sliding
        screens, such as are used to-day in Japan. One of the pairs is
        covered with dark green paper, and is for night use; the other is of
        the natural yellowish color of the oil-paper, and is used by day.
        When not wanted, they slide back into grooves inside the wall, whence
        they are pulled out again by ribbons fastened near the middle of the
        outer edge. All screens of this sort, whether in houses or
        palanquins, are provided, unlike the Japanese, with these
        conveniences for tying the two halves of each pair together, and thus
        enabling easier adjustment.‚Äù</span> The house-lining within is
        oil-paper. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPaper covers the ceiling, lines
        the wall, spreads the floor. As you sit in your room your eye falls
        upon nothing but paper; and the very light that enables you to see
        anything at all sifts in through the same material.‚Äù</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen by
        these brief extracts how dissimilar the Korean house is to that of
        the Japanese. And this dissimilarity is fully sustained by an
        examination of the photographs which Mr. Lowell made in Korea, and
        which show among other things low stone-walled houses with square
        openings for windows, closed by frames covered with paper, the frames
        hung from above and opening outside, and the roof tiled; also curious
        thatched roofs, in which the slopes are uneven and rounding, and
        their ridges curiously knotted or braided, differing in every respect
        from the many forms of thatched roof in Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chinese house,
        as I saw it in Shanghai and its suburbs, and at Canton as well as up
        the river, shows differences from the Japanese house quite as
        striking as those of the Korean house. Here one sees, in the cities
        at least, solid <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span>
        brick-walled houses, with kitchen range built into the wall, and
        chimney equally permanent; tiled-roof, with tiled ridges; enclosed
        court-yard; floors of stone, upon which the shoes are worn from the
        street; doorways, with doors on hinges; window openings closed by
        swinging frames fitted with the translucent shells of Placuna, or
        white paper, the latter usually in a dilapidated condition; and for
        furniture they have tables, chairs, bedsteads, drawers, babies'
        chairs, cradles, foot-stools, and thel like. The farm-houses of China
        in those regions that I visited were equally unlike similar houses in
        Japan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
        superficial glance at the character of the house in the outlying
        Islands of the Japanese Empire, as well as at the houses of the
        neighboring countries, Korea and China, I think it will be conceded
        that the Japanese house is typically a product of the people, with
        just those features from abroad incorporated in it that one might
        look for, considering the proximity to Japan of China and Korea. When
        we remember that these three great civilizations of the Mongoloid
        race approximate within the radius of a few hundred miles, and that
        they have been in more or less intimate contact since early historic
        times, we cannot wonder that the germs of Japanese art and letters
        should have been adopted from the continent. In precisely the same
        way our ancestors, the English, drew from their continent the
        material for their language, art, music, architecture, and many other
        important factors in their civilization; and if history speaks truly,
        their refinement even in language and etiquette was imported. But
        while Japan, like England, has modified and developed the germs
        ingrafted from a greater and older civilization, it has ever
        preserved the elasticity of youth, and seized upon the good things of
        our civilization,‚Äîsuch as steam, electricity, and modern methods of
        study and research,‚Äîand utilized them promptly. Far different is it
        from the mother <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span>
        country, where the improvements and methods of other nations get but
        tardy recognition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to give
        certain English writers peculiar delight to stigmatize the Japanese
        as a nation of imitators and copyists. From the contemptuous manner
        in which disparagements of this nature are flung into the faces of
        the Japanese who are engaged in their heroic work of establishing
        sound methods of government and education, one would think that in
        England had originated the characters by which the English people
        write, the paper upon which they print, the figures by which they
        reckon, the compass by which they navigate, the gunpowder by which
        they subjugate, the religion with which they worship. Indeed, when
        one looks over the long list of countries upon which England has
        drawn for the arts of music, painting, sculpture, architecture,
        printing, engraving, and a host of other things, it certainly comes
        with an ill-grace from natives of that country to taunt the Japanese
        with being imitators.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        obviously absurd to suggest as a model for our own houses such a
        structure as a Japanese house. Leaving out the fact that it is not
        adapted to the rigor of our climate or to the habits of our people,
        its fragile and delicate fittings if adopted by us, would be reduced
        to a mass of kindlings in a week, by the rude knocks it would
        receive; and as for exposing on our public thoroughfares the delicate
        labyrinth of carvings often seen on panel and post in Japan, the
        wide-spread vandalism of our country would render futile all such
        attempts to civilize and refine. Fortunately, in that land which we
        had in our former ignorance and prejudice regarded as uncivilized,
        the malevolent form of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">genus homo</span></em> called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‚Äúvandal‚Äù</span> is unknown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Believing that the
        Japanese show infinitely greater refinement in their methods of
        house-adornment than we do, and convinced that their tastes are
        normally artistic, I have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
        348]</span> endeavored to emphasize my convictions by holding up in
        contrast our usual methods of house-furnishing and outside
        embellishments. By so doing I do not mean to imply that we do not
        have in America interiors that show the most perfect refinement and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following
        list of Japanese words used in this work an opportunity is given to
        correct a number of mistakes which crept into, or rather walked
        boldly into, the text. The author lays no claim to a knowledge of the
        Japanese language beyond what any foreigner might naturally acquire
        in being thrown among the people for some time. As far as possible he
        has followed Hepburn's Japanese Dictionary for orthography and
        definition, and Brunton's Map of Japan for geographical names.
        Brunton's map, as well as that published by Rein, spells Settsu with
        one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">t.</span></em> For the sake of uniformity I have
        followed this spelling in the text, though it is contrary to the best
        authorities. It may be added that Oshiu and Totomi should be printed
        with a long accent over each <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">o.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words Samurai,
        Daimio, Kioto, Tokio, and several others, are now so commonly seen in
        the periodical literature of our country that this form of spelling
        for these words has been retained. For rules concerning the
        pronunciation of Japanese words the reader is referred to the
        Introduction in Hepburn's Dictionary.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. O.
            Korschelt has made an extremely valuable contribution to the
            Asiatic Society of Japan, on the water-supply of Tokio. Aided by
            Japanese students, he has made many analyses of well-waters and
            waters from the city supply, and shows that, contrary to the
            conclusions of Professor Atkinson, the high-ground wells are on
            the whole much purer than those on lower ground. Dr. Korschelt
            also calls attention to the great number of artesian wells sunk
            in Tokio, by means of bamboo tubes driven into the ground. The
            ordinary form of well is carried down thirty or forty feet in the
            usual way, and then at the bottom bamboo tubes are driven to
            great depths, ranging from one hundred to two hundred feet and
            more. He speaks of a number of these wells in Tokio and the
            suburbs as overflowing. There is one well not far from the Tokio
            Daigaku which overflows; and a very remarkable sight it is to see
            the water pouring over a high well-curb and flooding the ground
            in the vicinity. He shows that pure water may be reached in most
            parts of Tokio by means of artesian wells; and to this source the
            city must ultimately look for its water-supply.</p>

              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
              copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
              Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any
              particular paper edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each ebook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our ebooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
